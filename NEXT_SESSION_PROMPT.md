---

## Critical Requirements for ALL Tests

### 1. Pytest Best Practices
- Use fixtures from conftest.py
- Use parametrize for similar test cases
- Clear test names: `test_<class>_<method>_<scenario>_<expected>`
- Use AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- **Add docstrings to ALL test functions** (REQUIRED)
- **NEVER use `return` in test functions** - use `assert` statements

### 2. Mocking Strategy
- **Mock subprocess calls** for all external commands
- **Mock file I/O** for all file operations
- **Mock external services** (Docker, APIs, databases)
- **Use temp_dir fixture** for file-based tests
- **Mock heavy dependencies** to keep tests fast
- **Avoid deep integration** - focus on unit logic

### 3. Test Execution Speed
- **Run individual test files** to catch slow tests early
- **If any test takes >2 seconds**, investigate and fix immediately
- **Mock all I/O operations** (file, network, subprocess)
- **Use simple return values** not complex integrations
- **Target: All new tests complete in <1 second total**

### 4. Test Coverage
- **Test both success and failure paths**
- **Test edge cases:** missing files, invalid inputs, exceptions
- **Test boundary conditions:** empty lists, None values, edge inputs
- **Test error handling:** all exception types, subprocess failures
- **Test realistic scenarios** (actual workflows)

### 5. Test Quality
- **Each test must be independent**
- **Clean up all state changes** (files, environment variables)
- **Use proper assertions** (not just "no exception")
- **Verify actual logic** (not just mocking)
- **Test realistic scenarios** (actual use cases)
