# SDD Workflow Enhancements

This document tracks identified workflow improvements to make SDD more user-friendly and automated.

## Status Legend
- 🔵 IDENTIFIED - Enhancement identified, not yet implemented
- 🟡 IN_PROGRESS - Currently being worked on
- ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Completed and merged

---

## Enhancement #1: Auto Git Initialization in `sdd init`

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Problem
Users must manually run `git init` before running `sdd init`, which is an unnecessary friction point and easy to forget.

### Current Workflow
```bash
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
mkdir docs
# ... create docs files ...
git init              # ← Manual step required
sdd init
```

### Proposed Solution
Automatically detect and initialize git repository during `sdd init`:

```python
# In scripts/init_workflow.py

def check_or_init_git(project_root: Path) -> bool:
    """Check if git is initialized, if not initialize it."""
    git_dir = project_root / ".git"

    if git_dir.exists():
        print("✓ Git repository already initialized")
        return True

    try:
        # Initialize git
        subprocess.run(
            ["git", "init"],
            cwd=project_root,
            check=True,
            capture_output=True
        )
        print("✓ Initialized git repository")

        # Set default branch to main (modern convention)
        subprocess.run(
            ["git", "branch", "-m", "main"],
            cwd=project_root,
            check=True,
            capture_output=True
        )

        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"⚠️  Failed to initialize git: {e}")
        return False
```

### Benefits
- Eliminates manual step from setup
- Follows modern git conventions (main branch)
- Gracefully handles already-initialized repos
- One less thing for users to remember

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Add `check_or_init_git()` function to `scripts/init_workflow.py`
- [ ] Call it early in the init process (before creating .session directory)
- [ ] Add test for already-initialized repos
- [ ] Add test for new repo initialization
- [ ] Update documentation to remove manual `git init` step

---

## Enhancement #2: CHANGELOG Update Workflow

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Problem
Documentation quality gate fails if CHANGELOG isn't updated, but:
1. Users don't know they need to update it until `/sdd:end` fails
2. No guidance on what to add to CHANGELOG
3. Check is too strict (requires update in working directory vs. branch commits)

### Current Pain Point
```bash
# User runs sdd end
❌ Documentation: ✗ FAILED
  ✗ CHANGELOG updated

# User is confused - what should I update?
```

### Proposed Multi-Part Solution

#### Part A: Git Prepare-Commit-Msg Hook (Reminder)
Install during `sdd init` to remind users:

```bash
# .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg
#!/bin/bash

COMMIT_MSG_FILE=$1
COMMIT_SOURCE=$2

# Only run for regular commits (not merges, amends, etc.)
if [ -z "$COMMIT_SOURCE" ]; then
    cat >> "$COMMIT_MSG_FILE" << 'EOF'

# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
# REMINDERS:
#
# 📝 CHANGELOG: Update CHANGELOG.md for notable changes
#    (features, fixes, breaking changes)
#
# 💡 LEARNINGS: Add insights that will be auto-extracted during /sdd:end
#    LEARNING: <your learning here>
#
# Examples:
#    LEARNING: JWT refresh tokens should expire faster than access tokens
#    LEARNING: Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
EOF
fi
```

#### Part B: Smarter CHANGELOG Detection
Check for CHANGELOG updates in branch commits, not just working directory:

```python
# In scripts/quality_gates.py

def check_changelog_updated(self) -> tuple[bool, dict]:
    """Check if CHANGELOG was updated in the current branch."""
    try:
        # Get the base branch (usually main or master)
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["git", "rev-parse", "--abbrev-ref", "HEAD"],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True,
            cwd=self.project_root
        )
        current_branch = result.stdout.strip()

        # Don't check if we're on main/master
        if current_branch in ["main", "master"]:
            return True, {"status": "skipped", "reason": "On main branch"}

        # Check if CHANGELOG.md was modified in any commit on this branch
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["git", "log", "--name-only", "--pretty=format:", "main..HEAD"],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True,
            cwd=self.project_root
        )

        if "CHANGELOG.md" in result.stdout:
            return True, {"status": "updated", "message": "CHANGELOG updated in branch"}
        else:
            return False, {
                "status": "not_updated",
                "message": "CHANGELOG not updated in branch",
                "help": [
                    "Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes:",
                    "",
                    "## [Unreleased]",
                    "### Added",
                    "- Your feature or change here",
                    "",
                    "Then commit: git add CHANGELOG.md && git commit"
                ]
            }
    except Exception as e:
        return True, {"status": "error", "reason": f"Could not check: {e}"}
```

#### Part C: Better Error Messages
When CHANGELOG check fails, provide actionable guidance:

```python
if not changelog_updated:
    print("\n📝 CHANGELOG Update Required")
    print("=" * 60)
    print("Add your changes to CHANGELOG.md:")
    print()
    print("## [Unreleased]")
    print("### Added")
    print("- Feature: User authentication with JWT")
    print("- Tests: Comprehensive auth endpoint tests")
    print()
    print("Then commit:")
    print("  git add CHANGELOG.md")
    print("  git commit -m 'docs: Update CHANGELOG'")
    print("=" * 60)
```

### Benefits
- Proactive reminders during normal workflow
- Clear guidance on what to update
- Less strict check (branch-level vs working directory)
- Better error messages with examples

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Create git hooks template in `templates/git-hooks/prepare-commit-msg`
- [ ] Install hook during `sdd init`
- [ ] Make hook executable (`chmod +x`)
- [ ] Update `check_changelog_updated()` to check branch commits
- [ ] Add helpful error messages with examples
- [ ] Test with branches that have/haven't updated CHANGELOG
- [ ] Update documentation with CHANGELOG best practices

---

## Enhancement #3: Pre-flight Commit Check in `/sdd:end`

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Problem
Users run `/sdd:end` with uncommitted changes and get confusing error messages:
1. Error doesn't clearly state "you need to commit first"
2. No guidance on what to commit or how
3. Quality gate failure happens after running all checks (wastes time)

### Current Experience
```bash
sdd end
# ... runs all quality gates ...
❌ Documentation: ✗ FAILED
  ✗ CHANGELOG updated

# User is confused - they have uncommitted changes but error talks about CHANGELOG
```

### Proposed Solution

#### Early Pre-flight Check
Check for uncommitted changes BEFORE running quality gates:

```python
# In scripts/session_complete.py - add at the very start

def check_uncommitted_changes() -> bool:
    """Check for uncommitted changes and guide user to commit first."""
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["git", "status", "--porcelain"],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True,
            cwd=Path.cwd()
        )

        uncommitted = [line for line in result.stdout.split("\n") if line.strip()]

        # Filter out .session/tracking files (they're updated by sdd end)
        user_changes = [
            line for line in uncommitted
            if not line.strip().endswith(".session/tracking/")
        ]

        if not user_changes:
            return True  # All good

        # Display uncommitted changes
        print("\n" + "=" * 60)
        print("⚠️  UNCOMMITTED CHANGES DETECTED")
        print("=" * 60)
        print("\nYou have uncommitted changes:")
        print()

        for line in user_changes[:15]:  # Show first 15
            print(f"   {line}")

        if len(user_changes) > 15:
            print(f"   ... and {len(user_changes) - 15} more")

        print("\n" + "=" * 60)
        print("📋 REQUIRED STEPS BEFORE /sdd:end:")
        print("=" * 60)
        print()
        print("1. Review your changes:")
        print("   git status")
        print()
        print("2. Update CHANGELOG.md with session changes:")
        print("   ## [Unreleased]")
        print("   ### Added")
        print("   - Your feature or change")
        print()
        print("3. Commit everything:")
        print("   git add -A")
        print("   git commit -m 'Implement feature X")
        print()
        print("   LEARNING: Key insight from implementation")
        print()
        print("   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)")
        print("   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>'")
        print()
        print("4. Then run:")
        print("   sdd end")
        print()
        print("=" * 60)

        # In interactive mode, allow override
        if sys.stdin.isatty():
            print()
            response = input("Continue anyway? (y/n): ")
            return response.lower() == 'y'
        else:
            print("\nNon-interactive mode: exiting")
            print("Please commit your changes and run 'sdd end' again.")
            return False

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Warning: Could not check git status: {e}")
        return True  # Don't block on errors

# At the very start of main():
def main():
    print("Completing session...\n")

    # Pre-flight check - do this BEFORE quality gates
    if not check_uncommitted_changes():
        print("\n❌ Session completion aborted")
        print("Commit your changes and try again.\n")
        sys.exit(1)

    # Now run quality gates...
    print("Running comprehensive quality gates...\n")
    # ... rest of the function
```

### Benefits
- Fails fast - checks before running expensive quality gates
- Clear, actionable guidance with examples
- Shows exactly what files need to be committed
- Step-by-step instructions
- Still allows override in interactive mode for advanced users

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Add `check_uncommitted_changes()` function to `scripts/session_complete.py`
- [ ] Call it at the very start of `main()` before quality gates
- [ ] Filter out `.session/tracking/` files (updated by sdd end itself)
- [ ] Add clear, formatted error messages with step-by-step guidance
- [ ] Support interactive override (y/n prompt)
- [ ] Test with uncommitted changes
- [ ] Test with clean working directory
- [ ] Update `/sdd:end` command documentation

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Estimated: 1 session)
1. Enhancement #1: Git auto-init
2. Enhancement #3: Pre-flight commit check

### Phase 2: CHANGELOG Workflow (Estimated: 1-2 sessions)
1. Enhancement #2: Git hooks + smarter checking

### Testing Strategy
For each enhancement:
- Unit tests for new functions
- Integration test with full SDD workflow
- Test both interactive and non-interactive modes
- Verify error messages are clear and helpful

### Success Criteria
- Users can run `sdd init` without manual `git init`
- Users get clear guidance when `/sdd:end` fails
- CHANGELOG reminders appear during normal workflow
- Error messages provide actionable next steps
- No regressions in existing functionality

---

## Enhancement #4: Add OS-Specific Files to Initial .gitignore

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Problem
OS-specific files like `.DS_Store` (macOS) are not included in the initial `.gitignore` created during `sdd init`. This leads to:
1. These files being accidentally committed during the first session
2. Users having to manually add them to `.gitignore` mid-session
3. Extra commits to remove them from tracking

### Current Experience
```bash
# During first session
git add -A
git commit -m "..."
# .DS_Store gets committed

# Later, user has to:
# 1. Add .DS_Store to .gitignore
# 2. git rm --cached .DS_Store
# 3. Make another commit
```

### Proposed Solution
Update the `.gitignore` template in `templates/gitignore_template.txt` to include common OS-specific files:

```gitignore
# SDD-related patterns
.session/briefings/
.session/history/
coverage/
node_modules/
dist/
venv/
.venv/
*.pyc
__pycache__/

# OS-specific files
.DS_Store           # macOS
.DS_Store?          # macOS
._*                 # macOS resource forks
.Spotlight-V100     # macOS
.Trashes            # macOS
Thumbs.db           # Windows
ehthumbs.db         # Windows
Desktop.ini         # Windows
$RECYCLE.BIN/       # Windows
*~                  # Linux backup files
```

### Benefits
- Cleaner git history from the start
- No accidental commits of OS files
- Follows industry best practices
- Works across all major operating systems
- One less thing for users to worry about

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Update `templates/gitignore_template.txt` with OS-specific patterns
- [ ] Add comments explaining each pattern group
- [ ] Test on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- [ ] Verify patterns are correct and comprehensive
- [ ] Update initialization tests

---

## Enhancement #5: Create Initial Commit on Main During sdd init

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Problem
When `sdd init` creates a git repository, it doesn't create an initial commit on the main branch. This causes issues:
1. Documentation quality gate fails on first session (no main branch to compare against)
2. Users must manually create a main branch before `/sdd:end` works
3. Violates standard git workflow expectations

### Current Experience
```bash
sdd init
# Git initialized but no commits

sdd start work-item-1
# ... make changes ...

sdd end
# ❌ Documentation: FAILED - no main branch exists
# User has to manually: git branch main <commit-hash>
```

### Proposed Solution
After creating all initialization files, create an initial commit on the main branch:

```python
# In scripts/init_workflow.py

def create_initial_commit(project_root: Path):
    """Create initial commit after project initialization."""
    try:
        # Stage all initialized files
        subprocess.run(
            ["git", "add", "-A"],
            cwd=project_root,
            check=True,
            capture_output=True
        )

        # Create initial commit
        commit_message = """chore: Initialize project with Session-Driven Development

- Project structure and configuration files
- Quality gates and testing setup
- Session tracking infrastructure
- Documentation templates

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"""

        subprocess.run(
            ["git", "commit", "-m", commit_message],
            cwd=project_root,
            check=True,
            capture_output=True
        )

        print("✓ Created initial commit on main branch")
        return True

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"⚠️  Failed to create initial commit: {e}")
        print("You may need to commit manually before starting sessions")
        return False

# Call this at the end of init_project():
def init_project():
    # ... existing init code ...

    # Create initial commit (after all files are created)
    create_initial_commit(project_root)

    print("\n✅ SDD Initialized Successfully!")
```

### Benefits
- Establishes proper main branch baseline immediately
- Documentation quality gates work on first session
- Follows standard git workflow conventions
- No manual intervention needed
- Clean project history from the start

### Implementation Tasks
- [x] Add `create_initial_commit()` function to `scripts/init_project.py`
- [x] Call it after all initialization files are created
- [x] Include comprehensive commit message listing what was initialized
- [x] Handle errors gracefully (warn but don't fail init)
- [x] Update tests to verify initial commit exists
- [x] Test with both new repos and existing repos (handles existing repos by checking commit count)
- [x] Update documentation to reflect automatic initial commit

## Enhancement #6: Work Item Completion Status Control

**Status:** 🔵 IDENTIFIED

**Discovered:** 2025-10-23 (During Session 3 - Bug #20 implementation)

### Problem

The current workflow has two major issues with work item completion status:

1. **No prompt when ending session**: `/sdd:end` appears to default the work item status to "completed" without asking the user. This is problematic because:
   - Work items may span multiple sessions (not complete in one session)
   - Users have no explicit control over the completion status
   - If the work isn't done, the status is incorrectly set to completed

2. **No mid-session completion**: Users cannot mark a work item as complete during a session and immediately pick up the next work item without ending the session first. Current workflow:
   ```bash
   /start work_item_1       # Start work
   # ... work and complete work_item_1 ...
   /end                     # Must end session
   /start                   # Start new session for work_item_2
   ```

### Current Behavior

**When running `/sdd:end`:**
- Session ends
- Work item status is set (appears to default to "completed")
- No prompt asking: "Is this work item complete?"
- User has no explicit control

**Mid-session completion:**
- Not possible to mark work item as done and pick next one
- Must end session, then start new session
- Creates unnecessary session churn for small work items

### Expected Behavior

#### Part 1: Prompt for Work Item Completion Status

When running `/sdd:end`, ask the user:

```bash
$ /sdd:end

Running quality gates...
✓ Tests: pass
✓ Linting: pass
✓ Formatting: pass

Work item: "Learning Curator Bug Fix"

Is this work item complete?
1. Yes - Mark as completed (default)
2. No - Keep as in-progress (will resume in next session)
3. Cancel - Don't end session

Choice [1]: _
```

**Behavior:**
- **Option 1 (completed)**: Sets work item status to "completed", ends session
- **Option 2 (in-progress)**: Leaves work item status as "in_progress", ends session, work will be auto-resumed on next `/start`
- **Option 3 (cancel)**: Cancels `/end`, returns to session

**Non-interactive mode:**
- Add `--complete` flag: Forces completion
- Add `--incomplete` flag: Forces in-progress
- No flag: Interactive prompt (or default to incomplete for safety)

```bash
sdd end --complete      # Mark as complete
sdd end --incomplete    # Keep in-progress
sdd end                 # Prompt (interactive) or default incomplete (non-interactive)
```

#### Part 2: Mid-Session Work Item Completion

Add new command: `/work-complete` (or similar)

```bash
$ /work-complete

✓ Marked "Learning Curator Bug Fix" as completed

Starting next work item...

# Briefing for next work item
...
```

**Behavior:**
1. Runs quality gates for current work item
2. If gates pass, marks work item as completed
3. Automatically calls `get_next_work_item()` to find next work
4. Generates briefing for next work item
5. Updates session tracking to new work item
6. Continues same session (no session end/start churn)

**Alternative: Allow `/start` during active session**

```bash
$ /start work_item_2

⚠️  Warning: Work item "bug_fix_1" is currently in-progress.

Options:
1. Complete current work and start new work item
2. Abandon current work (mark incomplete) and start new work item
3. Cancel

Choice [1]: _
```

### Root Cause

**Part 1: No completion prompt**
- `scripts/session_complete.py` doesn't prompt for work item status
- Defaults to marking work item as complete (or leaves it in-progress?)
- User intent is not captured

**Part 2: No mid-session completion**
- Session-driven workflow assumes one session = one work item
- No command exists to complete work item without ending session
- Workflow inefficiency for small/quick work items

### Impact

**Part 1:**
- **User Confusion**: Status updates happen implicitly
- **Data Quality**: Work item status may be incorrect (marked complete when incomplete)
- **Multi-session Work**: No clear way to keep work item in-progress across sessions
- **Workflow Control**: Users lack explicit control over completion status

**Part 2:**
- **Workflow Inefficiency**: Must end/start session for each work item
- **Session Churn**: Creates many small sessions instead of one productive session
- **Productivity**: Slows down momentum when tackling multiple small items

### Proposed Solution

#### Part 1: Add Completion Status Prompt to `/sdd:end`

**Location:** `scripts/session_complete.py`

Add interactive prompt before updating work item status:

```python
def prompt_work_item_completion(work_item_title: str, non_interactive: bool = False) -> bool:
    """
    Prompt user to mark work item as complete or in-progress.

    Returns:
        True if work item should be marked complete
        False if work item should remain in-progress
    """
    if non_interactive:
        # In non-interactive mode, default to incomplete for safety
        # User must explicitly use --complete flag to mark as done
        return False

    print(f"\nWork item: \"{work_item_title}\"\n")
    print("Is this work item complete?")
    print("1. Yes - Mark as completed")
    print("2. No - Keep as in-progress (will resume in next session)")
    print("3. Cancel - Don't end session")
    print()

    while True:
        choice = input("Choice [1]: ").strip() or "1"

        if choice == "1":
            return True  # Mark complete
        elif choice == "2":
            return False  # Keep in-progress
        elif choice == "3":
            print("\nSession end cancelled")
            sys.exit(0)
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Enter 1, 2, or 3.")


def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("--complete", action="store_true", help="Mark work item as completed")
    parser.add_argument("--incomplete", action="store_true", help="Keep work item as in-progress")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # ... quality gates ...

    # Determine if non-interactive
    non_interactive = not sys.stdin.isatty() or args.complete or args.incomplete

    # Determine work item completion status
    if args.complete:
        is_complete = True
    elif args.incomplete:
        is_complete = False
    else:
        is_complete = prompt_work_item_completion(work_item_title, non_interactive)

    # Update work item status
    if is_complete:
        work_items_data["work_items"][work_item_id]["status"] = "completed"
        print(f"\n✓ Marking work item '{work_item_title}' as complete")
    else:
        # Keep as in_progress
        print(f"\n✓ Keeping work item '{work_item_title}' as in-progress (will resume in next session)")
```

#### Part 2: Add Mid-Session Completion Command

**Option A: New `/work-complete` command**

Create new slash command in `.claude/commands/work-complete.md`:

```markdown
# Work Complete

Mark the current work item as complete and start the next work item without ending the session.

Usage:
/work-complete

This command:
1. Validates current work meets quality gates
2. Marks current work item as completed
3. Finds and starts next available work item
4. Continues in same session (no session restart)

Use this when you've completed a work item mid-session and want to immediately start the next one.
```

**Implementation:** `scripts/work_complete.py`

```python
def main():
    # 1. Load current work item
    # 2. Run quality gates
    # 3. If passed, mark work item as completed
    # 4. Call get_next_work_item()
    # 5. Generate briefing for next work item
    # 6. Update session tracking
    # 7. Display new briefing
```

**Option B: Enhance `/start` to handle active work items**

Modify `scripts/briefing_generator.py` to allow starting new work when work is in-progress:

```python
def main():
    # ... existing arg parsing ...

    # Check if a work item is currently in-progress
    current_work = find_in_progress_work_item()

    if current_work and args.work_item_id and current_work != args.work_item_id:
        # User wants to switch work items
        print(f"⚠️  Work item '{current_work}' is currently in-progress.\n")
        print("Options:")
        print("1. Complete current work and start new work item")
        print("2. Abandon current work (mark incomplete) and start new work item")
        print("3. Cancel")

        choice = input("\nChoice [1]: ").strip() or "1"

        if choice == "1":
            # Run quality gates for current work
            # If pass, mark as completed
            # Start new work item
        elif choice == "2":
            # Leave current work as in-progress
            # Start new work item
        elif choice == "3":
            sys.exit(0)
```

### Benefits

**Part 1:**
- Explicit user control over work item completion
- Prevents incorrect status updates
- Supports multi-session work items properly
- Clear workflow for incomplete work

**Part 2:**
- Eliminates session churn for small work items
- Maintains productivity momentum
- Reduces overhead of session end/start cycle
- Allows tackling multiple small items in one session

### Implementation Tasks

**Part 1: Completion Prompt**
- [ ] Add `prompt_work_item_completion()` to `scripts/session_complete.py`
- [ ] Add `--complete` and `--incomplete` flags to argparse
- [ ] Update work item status logic to use prompt result
- [ ] Handle non-interactive mode (default to incomplete for safety)
- [ ] Add tests for interactive prompt
- [ ] Add tests for flag handling
- [ ] Update documentation for `/end` command

**Part 2: Mid-Session Completion**
- [ ] Decide on approach (new command vs enhanced `/start`)
- [ ] Implement chosen approach
- [ ] Add quality gate validation
- [ ] Add work item status updates
- [ ] Add briefing generation for next work item
- [ ] Add tests for mid-session transitions
- [ ] Update documentation

### Files Affected

**Part 1:**
- `scripts/session_complete.py` - Add completion prompt and flags
- `.claude/commands/end.md` - Document new flags

**Part 2 (Option A - new command):**
- `scripts/work_complete.py` - New script for mid-session completion
- `.claude/commands/work-complete.md` - New command documentation

**Part 2 (Option B - enhanced start):**
- `scripts/briefing_generator.py` - Add work item switching logic
- `.claude/commands/start.md` - Document work item switching

### Related Issues

- Related to Bug #21: `/start` command ignores work item ID argument
- Related to Bug #22: Git branch status not finalized when switching work items
- All three issues involve improving work item lifecycle management

### Priority

**Part 1:** High - Core workflow issue affecting data quality
**Part 2:** Medium - Nice to have for workflow efficiency
