SDD Scripts Package

This package contains all the core implementation scripts for Session-Driven Development.

Note: This is a hybrid packaging approach. The scripts still use sys.path manipulation
for imports, which will be refactored in a future version (Phase 5.8) to use proper
relative imports within a sdd/ package structure.

For contributors: When importing from other scripts, use the pattern:
    from scripts.module_name import ClassName

See CONTRIBUTING.md and README.md Architecture Notes for more details.
