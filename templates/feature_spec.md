# Feature: [Feature Name]

<!--
TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS:
- Replace [Feature Name] with the actual feature name
- Fill out all sections below with specific details
- Use concrete examples where possible
- Check off items in checklists as you complete them
- Remove these instructions before finalizing the spec
-->

## Overview

<!-- Provide a 2-3 sentence description of what this feature does and why it's needed -->

Brief description of what this feature does and why it's needed.

**Example:**
> This feature adds real-time notifications to the dashboard, alerting users when important events occur. It uses WebSocket connections to push updates without requiring page refreshes, improving user experience and reducing server load from polling.

## User Story

<!-- Describe who benefits and what they achieve with this feature -->

As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that [benefit].

**Example:**
> As a dashboard user, I want to receive real-time notifications when my tasks are updated so that I can respond quickly without constantly refreshing the page.

## Rationale

<!-- Explain the business value, problem being solved, or opportunity being addressed -->

Why is this feature important? What problem does it solve?

**Consider:**
- What pain point does this address?
- What business value does it provide?
- What happens if we don't build this?
- Are there user requests or metrics supporting this?

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- Specific, measurable criteria that must be met for this feature to be considered complete -->

- [ ] Users can see notifications in real-time without page refresh
- [ ] Notifications are displayed in a non-intrusive manner
- [ ] Users can dismiss individual notifications
- [ ] Users can view notification history for the past 30 days
- [ ] System sends notifications for all supported event types
- [ ] Notifications work across multiple browser tabs
- [ ] All tests pass including new notification tests
- [ ] Documentation is updated

## Implementation Details

### Approach

<!-- High-level technical approach and key design decisions -->

**Example:**
> We'll implement WebSocket connections using Socket.IO for bidirectional communication. The server will emit events when tasks are updated, and the client will listen for these events and update the UI. We'll use a notification queue on the backend to handle high-volume scenarios and ensure delivery.

### Components Affected

<!-- List all files, modules, or systems that will be modified -->

- Frontend: `src/components/NotificationCenter.tsx` (new)
- Frontend: `src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` (new)
- Frontend: `src/services/notificationService.ts` (new)
- Backend: `src/websocket/notificationHandler.ts` (new)
- Backend: `src/models/Notification.ts` (new)
- Database: `notifications` table (new)

### API Changes

<!-- Document all new or modified API endpoints, parameters, and responses -->

**New Endpoints:**

```typescript
// WebSocket connection endpoint
ws://api.example.com/notifications

// Events emitted:
{
  event: "task.updated",
  data: {
    taskId: string,
    title: string,
    changes: object,
    timestamp: Date
  }
}

// REST endpoint for notification history
GET /api/notifications?limit=50&offset=0
Response: {
  notifications: Notification[],
  total: number
}

// Mark notification as read
PATCH /api/notifications/:id/read
Response: {
  success: boolean
}
```

### Database Changes

<!-- Document all schema changes, migrations, and data transformations -->

**New Table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  message TEXT,
  data JSONB,
  read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  INDEX idx_user_created (user_id, created_at DESC)
);
```

**Migration:**
- File: `migrations/2025_10_add_notifications_table.sql`
- Rollback: Drop table and indexes

## Testing Strategy

<!-- Comprehensive testing approach for this feature -->

### Unit Tests
- NotificationCenter component rendering and interaction
- WebSocket connection lifecycle management
- Notification service message handling
- Database query functions

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end WebSocket communication
- Notification creation and retrieval flow
- Multi-tab notification synchronization
- Notification history pagination

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- [ ] Test with slow network connection
- [ ] Test with WebSocket connection drops and reconnects
- [ ] Test notification display with various content lengths
- [ ] Test concurrent notifications (stress test)
- [ ] Test notification persistence across page reloads

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] User documentation: How to manage notifications
- [ ] API documentation: WebSocket events and REST endpoints
- [ ] README updates: New WebSocket dependencies
- [ ] Architecture docs: Notification system design
- [ ] Deployment notes: WebSocket infrastructure requirements

## Dependencies

<!-- List any other work items, external libraries, or infrastructure this depends on -->

- `feature_user_authentication` (must be completed first)
- `refactor_websocket_infrastructure` (must be completed first)
- New dependency: `socket.io-client` ^4.5.0
- Infrastructure: WebSocket support in production load balancer

## Estimated Effort

[Number] sessions

<!--
Estimation guidelines:
- Simple feature (CRUD, UI update): 1-2 sessions
- Medium feature (new API, moderate complexity): 2-4 sessions
- Complex feature (multiple systems, data migration): 4-8 sessions
- Very complex feature (major architecture change): 8+ sessions
