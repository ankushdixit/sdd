# Bandit configuration for SDD (Session-Driven Development)
# https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html

[bandit]
# Exclude test directories from certain checks
exclude_dirs = ['/tests/']

# Skip specific checks that are acceptable for this CLI/automation tool
skips = B404,B603,B607

# B404: Consider possible security implications associated with subprocess module
#       Acceptable: SDD is a CLI tool that needs to run git, pytest, etc.
#       All subprocess calls use list form (not shell=True) and don't accept user input

# B603: subprocess call - check for execution of untrusted input
#       Acceptable: All subprocess calls use hardcoded commands or validated paths
#       No user-controlled input is passed to subprocess

# B607: Starting a process with a partial executable path
#       Acceptable: Using standard system tools (git, pytest, docker, etc.) from PATH
#       This is normal for CLI tools interacting with developer environments
