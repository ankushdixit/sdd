- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (methodology, formats, philosophy)

**Key Assets:**
- **Algorithms ready to use:**
  - Dependency resolution (DFS-based critical path analysis)
  - Learning categorization (keyword-based with 6 categories)
  - Similarity detection (Jaccard + containment, thresholds: 0.6/0.8)
- **Formats fully defined:**
  - Reference: session-driven-development.md lines 113-601 ("Key Files Explained" section)
  - work_items.json schema (with git tracking)
  - learnings.json structure
  - status_update.json format
  - stack.txt and stack_updates.json formats
  - tree.txt and tree_updates.json formats

### What's Missing (Phase 1 Will Add)
