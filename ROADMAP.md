## NOT Included (Out of Scope)

The following features are **NOT relevant** for personal Claude Code plugin:

❌ **Team collaboration features**
  - Multi-developer support
  - Session handoff between developers
  - Real-time collaboration
  - Team velocity tracking
  - Not needed for solo development

❌ **Role-based AI interaction**
  - AI as Product Manager, Architect, etc.
  - Too complex for solo development needs
  - Framework document provides philosophical guidance instead

❌ **Enterprise features**
  - SSO integration
  - Audit logs beyond git
  - Compliance reporting
  - Role-based access control
  - Not needed for personal tool

❌ **Package distribution**
  - PyPI publishing
  - Package versioning beyond plugin version
  - Installation documentation for external users
  - Community support
  - Plugin is for personal use only

❌ **External tool deep integrations**
  - Notion sync
  - Linear integration
  - Jira integration
  - Slack notifications
  - Discord webhooks
  - Too complex for personal tool

❌ **Web-based dashboard**
  - Metrics viewer UI
  - Trend analysis graphs
  - Export functionality
  - Terminal-based is sufficient

❌ **GitHub integration beyond git**
  - Sync work items with GitHub Issues
  - Create PRs from sessions
  - Link commits to work items
  - Status synchronization
  - Git workflow is sufficient

## Implementation Priority Order

**Phases 1-5.6 are CORE** - Must be implemented for plugin to be useful:

1. **Phase 1** (Core Plugin) - Foundation with tracking and git
2. **Phase 2** (Work Items) - Task management
3. **Phase 3** (Visualization) - Understanding structure
4. **Phase 4** (Learning) - Knowledge capture
5. **Phase 5** (Quality Gates) - Maintaining quality and security
6. **Phase 5.5** (Integration Testing) - System validation
7. **Phase 5.6** (Deployment) - Launch support

**Phases 6-7 are ENHANCEMENTS** - Implement based on needs:

8. **Phase 6** (Spec-Kit) - Specification-driven workflow
9. **Phase 7** (Advanced) - Polish and nice-to-haves

---

## Success Criteria

Plugin is **production-ready** when:

✅ Phase 1-5.6 complete
✅ Used successfully on 3+ different projects
✅ 20+ sessions completed without issues
✅ Zero context loss between sessions
✅ Quality gates prevent broken states
✅ Learnings accumulate automatically
✅ Stack and tree tracked accurately
✅ Git workflow prevents all common mistakes
✅ No need to touch terminal/scripts manually

Plugin is **mature** when:

✅ Phase 6 complete (spec-kit integration working)
✅ 50+ sessions completed
✅ Used on project with 100+ work items
✅ Dependency graphs with 20+ nodes
✅ 100+ learnings curated and categorized
✅ All quality gates passing consistently
✅ Zero manual tracking or documentation updates needed
