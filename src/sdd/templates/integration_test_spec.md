- Remove these instructions before finalizing the spec
-->

## Scope

<!-- Define which components are being integrated and tested -->

Define which components are being integrated and tested.

**Example:**
> This integration test validates the end-to-end order processing flow, including the Order API, Payment Service, Inventory Service, and Notification Service. It tests the happy path, error scenarios, and ensures data consistency across all services.

**Components:**
- Order API: `v2.3.0` (receives order requests, orchestrates workflow)
- Payment Service: `v1.8.2` (processes payments via Stripe)
- Inventory Service: `v2.1.0` (checks and reserves inventory)
- Notification Service: `v1.5.0` (sends email confirmations)
- Database: PostgreSQL `14.2` (order and inventory data)
- Message Queue: RabbitMQ `3.11` (async communication)

**Integration Points:**
- REST API: Order API → Payment Service (`POST /api/payments`)
- REST API: Order API → Inventory Service (`POST /api/inventory/reserve`)
- Message Queue: Order API → Notification Service (queue: `order.completed`)
- Database: All services → PostgreSQL (shared database)
- External API: Payment Service → Stripe API

## Test Scenarios

<!-- Document all test scenarios with sequence diagrams, setup, actions, and expected results -->

### Scenario 1: Successful Order Processing (Happy Path)

**Description:**
> Customer places an order for an in-stock item. Payment is processed successfully, inventory is reserved, and confirmation email is sent.

**Sequence Diagram:**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant OrderAPI
    participant PaymentService
    participant InventoryService
    participant NotificationQueue
    participant Database

    Client->>OrderAPI: POST /api/orders (order data)
    OrderAPI->>Database: Create order record (status: pending)
    OrderAPI->>InventoryService: POST /api/inventory/reserve
    InventoryService->>Database: Check stock availability
    Database-->>InventoryService: Stock available
    InventoryService->>Database: Reserve inventory
    InventoryService-->>OrderAPI: 200 OK (reservation_id)
    OrderAPI->>PaymentService: POST /api/payments
    PaymentService->>Stripe: Process payment
    Stripe-->>PaymentService: Payment successful
    PaymentService->>Database: Record payment
    PaymentService-->>OrderAPI: 200 OK (payment_id)
    OrderAPI->>Database: Update order (status: completed)
    OrderAPI->>NotificationQueue: Publish order.completed event
    OrderAPI-->>Client: 201 Created (order_id, status)
    NotificationQueue->>NotificationService: Consume event
    NotificationService->>SMTP: Send confirmation email
```

**Setup:**
- All services running (Order API on 8001, Payment on 8002, Inventory on 8003, Notification on 8004)
- PostgreSQL database seeded with test data:
  - Product ID `prod_123` with stock quantity 50
  - Customer ID `cust_456` with valid email
- RabbitMQ running on port 5672
- Stripe test mode enabled with test API key
- Mock SMTP server running

**Actions:**
1. Send POST request to `/api/orders` with payload:
```json
{
  "customer_id": "cust_456",
  "items": [{"product_id": "prod_123", "quantity": 2}],
  "payment_method": "card",
  "card_token": "tok_visa_test"
}
```
2. Wait for order processing (max 5 seconds)
3. Check order status via `GET /api/orders/{order_id}`
4. Verify email sent via SMTP mock

**Expected Results:**
- HTTP 201 response with order details:
```json
{
  "order_id": "ord_789",
  "status": "completed",
  "total": 49.98,
  "payment_id": "pay_123",
  "reservation_id": "res_456"
}
```
- Database state:
  - Order record created with status `completed`
  - Payment record created
  - Inventory reduced by 2 (from 50 to 48)
- Notification sent:
  - Email queued in RabbitMQ
  - Email delivered via SMTP mock
  - Email contains order ID and confirmation details
- Logs show successful processing in all services
- Response time < 2000ms (p95)

### Scenario 2: Insufficient Inventory (Error Handling)

**Description:**
> Customer attempts to order more items than available in stock. Order should fail gracefully without charging payment or corrupting data.

**Sequence Diagram:**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant OrderAPI
    participant InventoryService
    participant Database

    Client->>OrderAPI: POST /api/orders (quantity > stock)
    OrderAPI->>Database: Create order record (status: pending)
    OrderAPI->>InventoryService: POST /api/inventory/reserve
    InventoryService->>Database: Check stock availability
    Database-->>InventoryService: Insufficient stock
    InventoryService-->>OrderAPI: 409 Conflict (insufficient_stock)
    OrderAPI->>Database: Update order (status: failed)
    OrderAPI-->>Client: 409 Conflict (error details)
```

**Setup:**
- Product ID `prod_789` with stock quantity 5
- Customer requests quantity 10

**Actions:**
1. Send POST request with `quantity: 10` for product with stock 5
2. Observe order creation and inventory check

**Expected Results:**
- HTTP 409 Conflict response:
```json
{
  "error": "insufficient_stock",
  "message": "Requested quantity (10) exceeds available stock (5)",
  "product_id": "prod_789",
  "available": 5,
  "requested": 10
}
```
- Database state:
  - Order record created with status `failed`
  - Inventory unchanged (still 5)
  - No payment record created
- No email sent
- Logs contain error with context

## Performance Benchmarks

<!-- Define quantitative performance requirements for the integration -->

**Response Time Requirements:**
- p50 (median): < 500ms
- p95: < 2000ms
- p99: < 5000ms
- p99.9: < 10000ms

**Example:** Order processing should complete within 2 seconds for 95% of requests under normal load.

**Throughput Requirements:**
- Minimum: 50 orders/minute (baseline for production)
- Target: 200 orders/minute (target for peak traffic)
- Maximum tested: 500 orders/minute (stress test)

**Resource Limits:**
- CPU: < 70% utilization per service (average under load)
- Memory: < 1GB per service (Order API, Payment, Inventory, Notification)
- Database connections: < 50 active connections
- Message queue depth: < 1000 messages
- Disk I/O: < 50MB/s

**Load Test Configuration:**
```yaml
load_test:
  ramp_up: 5 minutes        # Gradually increase load
  sustained: 15 minutes     # Maintain peak load
  ramp_down: 5 minutes      # Gradually decrease load
  scenarios:
    - name: "happy_path"
      weight: 80%           # 80% of requests are successful orders
    - name: "insufficient_stock"
      weight: 15%           # 15% fail due to stock issues
    - name: "payment_failure"
      weight: 5%            # 5% fail due to payment issues
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] p95 response time < 2000ms under 200 orders/minute
- [ ] No errors under sustained load for 15 minutes
- [ ] All services recover gracefully after spike (500 orders/minute for 1 minute)
