```

### Deployment Steps

<!-- Execute these steps in order during the deployment window -->

**Step 1: Prepare New Version (Blue Environment)**
```bash
# Pull latest Docker image
docker pull order-api:2.5.0-abc123

# Verify image integrity
docker inspect order-api:2.5.0-abc123 | grep Created
```

**Step 2: Run Database Migrations**
```bash
# Connect to production database (read-write connection)
psql postgresql://admin:${DB_PASSWORD}@prod-db.example.com:5432/orders

# Run migration (idempotent, safe to re-run)
\i migrations/025_add_order_metadata.sql

# Verify migration
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'orders' AND column_name = 'order_metadata';
# Expected: order_metadata

# Check row count (should not change)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;
# Expected: same as before migration
```

**Step 3: Deploy to Blue Environment**
```bash
# Update ECS task definition with new image
aws ecs register-task-definition \
  --cli-input-json file://task-definition-v2.5.0.json

# Update service to use new task definition (Blue environment)
aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster production \
  --service order-api-blue \
  --task-definition order-api:42 \
  --desired-count 3

# Wait for deployment to complete (5-10 minutes)
aws ecs wait services-stable \
  --cluster production \
  --services order-api-blue
```

**Step 4: Run Smoke Tests on Blue**
```bash
# Execute smoke test suite against blue environment
npm run smoke-test -- --url https://blue.order-api.internal

# Expected output:
# ✓ Health check passed
# ✓ Create order endpoint working
# ✓ Payment processing functional
# ✓ Database connectivity verified
# All smoke tests passed (4/4)
```

**Step 5: Switch Traffic (Blue-Green Cutover)**
```bash
# Update load balancer to route traffic to Blue
aws elbv2 modify-rule \
  --rule-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:123456:rule/abc123 \
  --actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:123456:targetgroup/order-api-blue

# Monitor traffic switch (gradual if using weighted routing)
watch -n 5 'aws elbv2 describe-target-health \
  --target-group-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:123456:targetgroup/order-api-blue'
```

**Step 6: Monitor New Version**
```bash
# Watch error rate in real-time (should stay < 1%)
watch -n 10 'curl -s "https://api.datadoghq.com/api/v1/query?query=sum:api.errors{service:order-api}.as_rate()" -H "DD-API-KEY: ${DD_API_KEY}"'

# Watch response time (p95 should be < 500ms)
watch -n 10 'curl -s "https://api.datadoghq.com/api/v1/query?query=p95:api.response_time{service:order-api}" -H "DD-API-KEY: ${DD_API_KEY}"'

# Check application logs
kubectl logs -n production -l app=order-api --tail=100 -f
```

### Post-Deployment Steps

## Rollback Procedure

<!-- Detailed procedure for rolling back if deployment fails -->

### Rollback Triggers

**Automatic Rollback (if enabled):**
- Smoke tests fail (any test fails)
- Error rate exceeds 5% for 5 consecutive minutes
- Response time p95 > 1000ms for 5 minutes
- Health check failures > 50% of instances

**Manual Rollback Decision:**
- Critical bug discovered in production
- Data corruption detected
- Performance degradation > 50%
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Customer-facing feature broken

### Rollback Steps

**IMPORTANT: Rollback must be executed within 30 minutes of deployment**

**Step 1: Stop New Deployments**
```bash
# Pause auto-scaling to prevent new tasks
aws application-autoscaling register-scalable-target \
  --service-namespace ecs \
  --resource-id service/production/order-api-blue \
  --scalable-dimension ecs:service:DesiredCount \
  --suspended-state DynamicScalingInSuspended=true,DynamicScalingOutSuspended=true
```

**Step 2: Switch Traffic Back to Green (Previous Version)**
```bash
# Immediate cutover back to old version
aws elbv2 modify-rule \
  --rule-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:123456:rule/abc123 \
  --actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:123456:targetgroup/order-api-green

# Verify traffic switched
curl https://api.example.com/health
# Expected: {"status": "healthy", "version": "2.4.0"} (old version)
```

**Step 3: Rollback Database Migration (if needed)**
```bash
# ONLY if migration caused issues
psql postgresql://admin:${DB_PASSWORD}@prod-db.example.com:5432/orders

# Run rollback migration
\i migrations/025_add_order_metadata_rollback.sql

# Verify rollback
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'orders' AND column_name = 'order_metadata';
# Expected: (empty) - column removed
```

**Step 4: Scale Down Failed Version**
```bash
# Stop Blue environment (failed version)
aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster production \
  --service order-api-blue \
  --desired-count 0
```

**Step 5: Verify Rollback Success**
```bash
# Run smoke tests against rolled-back version
npm run smoke-test -- --url https://api.example.com

# Check error rate (should drop to normal < 1%)
# Check response times (should return to baseline)
# Verify critical user flows working
```

**Step 6: Post-Rollback Actions**
- [ ] Notify team of rollback via Slack
- [ ] Create incident post-mortem
- [ ] Document root cause
- [ ] Create bug fix work item
- [ ] Schedule fix deployment

### Rollback Time Estimate
- Traffic switch: < 1 minute
- Full rollback (with DB): < 5 minutes
- Verification: < 10 minutes
- **Total rollback time: < 15 minutes**

## Smoke Tests

<!-- Critical tests that must pass for deployment to be considered successful -->

### Test 1: Health Check
```bash
curl https://api.example.com/health
# Expected: {"status": "healthy", "version": "2.5.0", "database": "connected"}
# Pass criteria: HTTP 200, status = healthy
```

### Test 2: Create Order (End-to-End)
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/api/orders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TEST_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "test_customer_123",
    "items": [{"product_id": "prod_456", "quantity": 1}],
    "payment_method": "card",
    "card_token": "tok_visa_test"
  }'
# Expected: HTTP 201, order_id returned, status = completed
# Pass criteria: Order created, payment processed, inventory reserved
```

### Test 3: Retrieve Order
```bash
curl https://api.example.com/api/orders/test_order_123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TEST_TOKEN}"
# Expected: HTTP 200, order details returned
# Pass criteria: Order data matches expected structure
```

### Test 4: Database Connectivity
```bash
curl https://api.example.com/api/internal/db-check \
  -H "X-Internal-Token: ${INTERNAL_TOKEN}"
# Expected: {"database": "connected", "latency_ms": < 50}
# Pass criteria: Database reachable, latency < 100ms
```

### Smoke Test Execution
```bash
# Automated smoke test suite
npm run smoke-test -- \
  --url https://api.example.com \
  --token ${TEST_TOKEN} \
  --timeout 30000 \
  --retries 3

# Expected output:
# ✓ Health check passed (45ms)
# ✓ Create order passed (234ms)
# ✓ Retrieve order passed (12ms)
# ✓ Database connectivity passed (8ms)
#
# All smoke tests passed (4/4)
# Total time: 299ms
```

## Monitoring & Alerting

<!-- Key metrics to monitor during and after deployment -->

**Dashboard:** https://app.datadoghq.com/dashboard/order-api-production

**Key Metrics:**
- Error rate (target: < 1%, alert: > 5%)
- Response time p95 (target: < 500ms, alert: > 1000ms)
- Throughput (baseline: 100 req/min, alert: < 50 req/min)
- Database connection pool (target: < 80%, alert: > 90%)
- Memory usage (target: < 80%, alert: > 90%)
- CPU usage (target: < 70%, alert: > 85%)

**Alerts:**
- High error rate: > 5% for 5 minutes → Page on-call
- Slow responses: p95 > 1000ms for 5 minutes → Slack alert
- Health check failures: > 50% instances → Page on-call
- Database connection exhaustion: > 90% → Page on-call

**Log Queries:**
```bash
# View recent errors
aws logs tail /aws/ecs/order-api --follow --filter-pattern "ERROR"

# View deployment-related logs
aws logs tail /aws/ecs/order-api --follow --filter-pattern "deployment" --since 30m
```

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- Deployment is considered successful when these criteria are met -->

- [ ] All pre-deployment checks passed
- [ ] Database migration completed successfully (column added)
- [ ] Blue environment deployed and stable (3 tasks running)
- [ ] All smoke tests passed (4/4 tests green)
- [ ] Traffic switched to new version (Blue)
- [ ] Error rate < 1% for 30 minutes post-deployment
- [ ] Response time p95 < 500ms (no regression)
- [ ] No critical alerts fired
- [ ] Critical user flows verified manually
- [ ] Old version (Green) scaled down after 1 hour soak period
- [ ] Deployment documented and team notified
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested and ready if needed

## Post-Deployment Monitoring Period

**Soak Time:** 1 hour (monitor new version before scaling down old)

**Monitoring checklist (during soak time):**
- [ ] 0-15 min: Watch error rate and response time closely
- [ ] 15-30 min: Verify no alerts, check logs for warnings
- [ ] 30-45 min: Verify database performance, check slow queries
- [ ] 45-60 min: Final check of all metrics, prepare to scale down old version

**If issues detected during soak time:**
1. Evaluate severity (critical vs minor)
2. Decide: rollback vs hotfix vs acceptable
3. If rollback: execute rollback procedure
4. If hotfix: create urgent fix and deploy
5. If acceptable: document issue and create follow-up work item

## Dependencies

<!-- Other work items or infrastructure that must be in place -->

- `feature_payment_v2` (must be completed - provides new Stripe integration)
- `integration_test_order_flow` (must pass - validates end-to-end flow)
- Infrastructure: ALB target groups for blue-green deployment (must exist)
- Database migration 024 (must be applied - adds required indexes)

## Estimated Effort

1 session (includes deployment, monitoring, and verification)

<!--
Breakdown:
- Pre-deployment prep: 0.25 sessions
- Deployment execution: 0.25 sessions
- Smoke testing: 0.25 sessions
- Post-deployment monitoring (1 hour soak): 0.25 sessions
