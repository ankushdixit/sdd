## Bug #XX: [Bug Title]

**Status:** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL / ðŸŸ  HIGH / ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM / ðŸŸ¢ LOW

**Discovered:** YYYY-MM-DD (During [context: session, testing, production, etc.])

### Description

Clear, concise description of the bug and its impact on users/system.

**Example:**
> User authentication fails intermittently when logging in from mobile devices. Users see a "Session expired" error even though they just created a new session. This affects approximately 15% of mobile login attempts based on error logs.

### Steps to Reproduce

Detailed steps that reliably reproduce the bug:

1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

**Environment:**
- Device/Browser: [e.g., iPhone 14 Pro, Chrome 119]
- OS Version: [e.g., iOS 17.0, Windows 11]
- App/System Version: [e.g., v2.3.1]
- Network: [e.g., WiFi, 5G]

### Expected Behavior

What should happen when the user performs the steps above.

### Actual Behavior

What actually happens, including error messages, logs, screenshots.

**Error Log (if applicable):**
```
[Include relevant error messages or log entries]
```

**Screenshot:** [Attach or describe visual issues]

### Impact

- **Severity:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low] (with justification)
- **Affected Users:** [percentage/number of users affected]
- **Affected Versions:** [which versions have this bug]
- **Business Impact:** [effect on metrics, user experience, revenue]
- **Workaround:** [temporary fix if available, or "None"]

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Investigation

Document what you did to investigate: logs reviewed, code analyzed, experiments run.

**Example:**
1. Reviewed application logs for past 7 days
2. Identified pattern: failures only occur on mobile devices
3. Checked cache metrics: intermittent connection timeouts
4. Analyzed relevant code in [file:line]
5. Reproduced locally with [conditions]

**Key Findings:**
- Finding 1
- Finding 2
- Finding 3

#### Root Cause

The underlying technical cause of the bug.

**Code:**
```python
# Current buggy code in file.py:47-52
def problematic_function():
    # Show the problematic code
    pass
```

#### Why It Happened

Why was this bug introduced? What can we learn?

**Contributing Factors:**
- Factor 1 (e.g., insufficient testing)
- Factor 2 (e.g., missing monitoring)
- Factor 3 (e.g., incorrect assumptions)

### Fix Approach

How will this bug be fixed? Include code changes if relevant.

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Fixed code in file.py:47-58
def fixed_function():
    # Show the corrected code
    pass
```

**Files Modified:**

- [ ] Comprehensive tests added to prevent regression
- [ ] No new bugs or regressions introduced by the fix
- [ ] Edge cases identified in investigation are handled
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, and manual)

### Testing Strategy

#### Regression Tests
- [ ] Add unit test for [specific scenario]
- [ ] Add integration test for [workflow]
- [ ] Add test to verify [edge case]

#### Manual Verification
- [ ] Test on [environment/device]
- [ ] Test with [specific conditions]
- [ ] Verify [expected outcome]

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] Test with [edge case 1]
- [ ] Test with [edge case 2]

### Prevention

How can we prevent similar bugs in the future?
