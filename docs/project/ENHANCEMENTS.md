## Enhancement #11: Enhanced Session Briefings with Context Continuity

**Status:** âœ… IMPLEMENTED (Session 14)

**Discovered:** 2025-10-25 (During Session 11 - Enhancement #6 implementation)
**Implemented:** 2025-10-26 (Session 14)

### Problem

Session briefings currently lack critical context for multi-session work items and relevant learnings:

**Missing Previous Work Context for In-Progress Items:**
- When resuming an `in_progress` work item, Claude has no deterministic context about what was done in previous sessions
- Git commits exist but may not be fetched by Claude
- Session summaries exist but are not included in briefings
- Claude must manually search git history or read changed files to understand progress
- This creates friction and potential gaps in understanding

**Missing Relevant Learnings:**
- Learnings from previous sessions are stored in `.session/tracking/learnings.json`
- These learnings are never included in briefings
- Claude must manually search learnings, which may not happen
- Valuable context and insights are lost between sessions

**Why Briefings Matter:**
- The briefing file is **guaranteed to be in Claude's context** at session start
- Git history, learnings, and other sources may or may not be fetched
- Briefings provide deterministic, reliable context delivery

### Current Behavior

**For In-Progress Work Items:**
```markdown
## Quick Reference
- **Work Item ID:** feature_example
- **Status:** in_progress

## Work Item Specification
[Full spec from .session/specs/]

## Dependencies
[Dependency list]
```

**For All Work Items:**
- No learnings included
- No way to see related insights from past sessions
- Claude must manually search `.session/tracking/learnings.json`

### Expected Behavior

**1. Previous Work Section for In-Progress Items:**

```markdown
## Previous Work

### Session 11 (2025-10-25)
**Status:** Session ended with work item in-progress (incomplete)

**Git Commits:**
- e227799: feat: Add work item completion status control to /sdd:end
  - Added interactive 3-choice prompt
  - Added --complete and --incomplete flags
  - Updated documentation

**Files Changed:**
- src/sdd/session/complete.py (+80 lines)
- tests/unit/test_session_complete.py (+60 lines)
- .claude/commands/end.md (+32 lines)
- CHANGELOG.md (+9 lines)

**Quality Gates:**
- âœ“ Tests: PASSED (85.48% coverage)
- âœ“ Security: PASSED
- âœ“ Linting: PASSED
- âœ“ Formatting: PASSED
- âœ“ Documentation: PASSED

**Session Summary:**
All acceptance criteria partially implemented:
- [x] Interactive prompt added
- [x] Command-line flags added
- [x] Tests written (8 unit tests)
- [ ] Integration tests needed (deferred to next session)
- [x] Documentation updated
```

**2. Relevant Learnings Section for All Work Items:**

```markdown
## Relevant Learnings

### From Similar Work
- **Session 5** (work_item: feature_git_integration):
  "When adding interactive prompts to CLI tools, always provide both interactive
   and non-interactive modes. Default to safest option in non-interactive."

- **Session 8** (work_item: bug_quality_gates):
  "Python subprocess calls need sys.executable instead of 'python3' to ensure
   venv Python is used."

### From Related Topics
- **Session 3** (topic: testing):
  "Mock input() calls need to return exact expected values ('1', '2', '3')
   not legacy values ('y', 'n')."
```

### Root Cause

**`src/sdd/session/briefing.py` Limitations:**
- Doesn't detect when work item is `in_progress` vs `not_started`
- Doesn't load previous session summaries for in-progress items
- Doesn't extract git commit history from the work item's git metadata
- Doesn't search or filter learnings by relevance to current work item
- Doesn't include any learning context in briefings

**Data Sources Available but Not Used:**
1. `.session/tracking/work_items.json` - Contains git commits array
2. `.session/history/session_NNN_summary.md` - Contains previous session details
3. `.session/tracking/learnings.json` - Contains all captured learnings
4. Git history via `git log <branch>` - Contains detailed commit information

### Impact

**High Impact:**
- **Context Loss**: Critical information about previous work is lost between sessions
- **Duplicate Work**: Claude may re-implement already-completed parts
- **Missed Insights**: Relevant learnings are not surfaced automatically
- **Inefficiency**: Claude must manually search for context that should be provided
- **Inconsistency**: Whether context is found depends on whether Claude searches (non-deterministic)

**Multi-Session Workflow Broken:**
- The new `--incomplete` flag enables multi-session work items
- But without previous work context, continuation is difficult
- Claude starts each session "cold" without knowing what was done

### Proposed Solution

**Phase 1: Previous Work Section for In-Progress Items**

Modify `src/sdd/session/briefing.py` to:

1. **Detect in-progress status:**
   ```python
   if work_item["status"] == "in_progress":
       briefing += generate_previous_work_section(work_item, work_item_id)
   ```

2. **Load session summaries:**
   ```python
   def get_previous_sessions(work_item_id):
       # Find all session summaries that worked on this work item
       # Parse session_NNN_summary.md files
       # Return list of session numbers and summaries
   ```

3. **Extract git commits:**
   ```python
   def format_git_commits(work_item):
       commits = work_item.get("git", {}).get("commits", [])
       # Format with sha, message, timestamp
       # Optionally include file change stats via git diff
   ```

4. **Include quality gate results:**
   ```python
   # Load from session summary
   # Show which gates passed/failed in previous session
   ```

**Phase 2: Relevant Learnings for All Work Items**

1. **Learning Relevance Scoring:**
   ```python
   def find_relevant_learnings(work_item, all_learnings):
       # Score learnings by:
       # - Keyword match with work item title/spec
       # - Same work item type (feature/bug/refactor)
       # - Related files (if learning mentions files in current work)
       # - Recency (recent learnings weighted higher)
       # Return top 5-10 most relevant
   ```

2. **Learning Categories:**
   - **From Similar Work**: Learnings from same work item type
   - **From Related Topics**: Learnings mentioning similar concepts
   - **From Modified Files**: Learnings about files being changed

3. **Learning Format in Briefing:**
   ```markdown
   ## Relevant Learnings

   ### [Category]
   - **Session X** (work_item: ...):
     "Learning content..."
     [Relevance: Mentions similar file/concept/pattern]
   ```

### Implementation Tasks

**Phase 1: Previous Work Section**
- [ ] Add `generate_previous_work_section()` function
- [ ] Add `get_previous_sessions()` to find related session summaries
- [ ] Add `format_git_commits()` to extract commit details
- [ ] Add `get_session_quality_gates()` to load previous quality results
- [ ] Integrate into main briefing generation flow
- [ ] Add tests for previous work section generation
- [ ] Test with actual in-progress work item

**Phase 2: Relevant Learnings**
- [ ] Add `find_relevant_learnings()` function with scoring algorithm
- [ ] Add keyword matching logic (work item title, spec content)
- [ ] Add file-based relevance (learnings mentioning files in work item)
- [ ] Add type-based relevance (same work item type)
- [ ] Add recency weighting
- [ ] Format learnings section for briefing
- [ ] Add tests for learning relevance scoring
- [ ] Add tests for learning section generation

**Documentation:**
- [ ] Update `docs/architecture/session-driven-development.md`
- [ ] Add examples to briefing documentation
- [ ] Update `.claude/commands/start.md` to mention enhanced context

### Files Affected

**Modified:**
- `src/sdd/session/briefing.py` - Add previous work and learnings sections
- `src/sdd/work_items/spec_parser.py` - May need to extract keywords from specs
- Tests for briefing generation

**New (maybe):**
- `src/sdd/learning/relevance.py` - Learning scoring and filtering logic

### Benefits

**Deterministic Context Delivery:**
- âœ“ Previous work context guaranteed in briefing
- âœ“ Relevant learnings guaranteed in briefing
- âœ“ No reliance on Claude manually searching

**Better Multi-Session Support:**
- âœ“ Claude knows exactly what was done before
- âœ“ Can continue work seamlessly
- âœ“ Avoids duplicate implementation

**Knowledge Reuse:**
- âœ“ Past learnings automatically surfaced
- âœ“ Common patterns reused across work items
- âœ“ Mistakes avoided through shared insights

**Improved Quality:**
- âœ“ Better informed implementation decisions
- âœ“ Consistency across sessions
- âœ“ Reduced context-gathering overhead

### Priority

**High** - Critical for multi-session workflow success

The new `--incomplete` flag (Enhancement #6) enables multi-session work items, but without enhanced briefing context, the workflow is incomplete. This enhancement makes multi-session work practical and efficient.

### Related

- **Enhancement #6**: Work Item Completion Status Control (enables multi-session work)
- **Learning System**: Already captures learnings, needs to surface them in briefings
