## Identified Enhancements

### Enhancement #12: Change `/sdd:end` Default to Complete

**Status:** 🔵 IDENTIFIED

**Problem:**

Currently, `/sdd:end` defaults to marking work items as "in-progress" when no flags are provided in non-interactive mode:

```python
# src/sdd/session/complete.py:731
if non_interactive:
    # In non-interactive mode, default to incomplete for safety
    return False  # Returns False = in-progress
```

This default is counterintuitive because:
- Most work items are completed when ending a session
- Users rarely end a session with incomplete work
- The "safe" default should match the common case
- It's easier to use `--incomplete` when needed than to always use `--complete`

**Current Behavior:**
- Interactive mode: Prompts with default choice "1. Yes - Mark as completed"
- Non-interactive mode: Defaults to in-progress (incomplete)
- `--complete` flag: Marks as completed
- `--incomplete` flag: Keeps as in-progress

**Expected Behavior:**
- Interactive mode: Keep current behavior (default to completed)
- Non-interactive mode: Default to completed (not in-progress)
- `--incomplete` flag: Keep as in-progress (when needed)
- `--complete` flag: Can be kept for explicitness or deprecated

**Rationale:**
- **Common case**: 90%+ of session ends are when work is complete
- **Consistency**: Interactive mode defaults to complete (choice 1)
- **Simpler workflow**: Don't need `--complete` flag every time
- **Explicit incomplete**: When work is incomplete, user can specify `--incomplete`

**Implementation:**

Change line 738-740 in `src/sdd/session/complete.py`:

```python
# FROM:
if non_interactive:
    # In non-interactive mode, default to incomplete for safety
    return False

# TO:
if non_interactive:
    # In non-interactive mode, default to complete (most common case)
    return True
```

Update documentation in `.claude/commands/end.md` line 96:

```markdown
# FROM:
**Note**: Without flags in non-interactive mode, the work item defaults to "in-progress" for safety.

# TO:
**Note**: Without flags in non-interactive mode, the work item defaults to "completed".
Use `--incomplete` to keep the work item as in-progress for multi-session work.
```

**Files Affected:**
- `src/sdd/session/complete.py` (line 738-740)
- `.claude/commands/end.md` (line 96)
- Tests for session completion

**Priority:** Medium - Quality of life improvement

### Enhancement #13: Template-Based Project Initialization

**Status:** 🔵 IDENTIFIED

**Problem:**

Currently, `/sdd:init` provides basic initialization for three base language types (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript) with generic configurations. This creates several issues:

1. **Manual configuration required**: After init, developers must manually configure framework-specific tools (Next.js, FastAPI, T3 Stack, etc.)
2. **Quality gates may not work**: Tools like linting and formatting may fail if dependencies aren't installed or configs are missing
3. **No CI/CD setup**: Developers must manually create CI/CD pipeline configurations
4. **Single-language limitation**: No support for full-stack projects with multiple languages (e.g., Python backend + TypeScript frontend)
5. **Slow onboarding**: Developers spend 10-20 minutes setting up tooling before they can start working

**Example of current --fix issue:**

In a Next.js project after basic init, `/sdd:validate --fix` may fail because:
- ESLint and Prettier might not be installed with Next.js-specific plugins
- Config files (`.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`) might be generic or missing framework rules
- Quality gate commands aren't optimized for the framework

**Proposed Solution:**

Implement a **template-based initialization system** where `/sdd:init` prompts the user to select a project template from curated options. Each template provides:

1. **Complete toolchain setup**
   - Framework-specific dependencies and configurations
   - Pre-configured linting rules (framework-specific plugins)
   - Pre-configured formatting rules
   - Testing framework setup with framework-specific utilities

2. **Framework-optimized quality gates**
   - Tailored linting commands with correct extensions and plugins
   - Framework-specific test commands
   - Security scanning configured for the framework's ecosystem
   - Documentation requirements appropriate to the framework

3. **CI/CD pipeline generation**
   - Optional CI/CD platform selection (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
   - Pre-configured workflows with jobs for tests, linting, security scans
   - Framework-specific build and deployment steps
   - Preview deployment configurations

4. **Multi-language/monorepo support**
   - Full-stack templates (e.g., TypeScript frontend + Python backend)
   - Monorepo configurations (Turborepo, Nx, etc.)
   - Proper workspace structure and dependency management

5. **Development environment**
   - Docker Compose files for local development (if applicable)
   - Environment variable templates (`.env.example`)
   - IDE/editor configurations (VSCode settings, etc.)
   - Development scripts and utilities

**High-Level Architecture:**

```

  └── ...
```

**Implementation Phases:**

**Phase 1: Template Infrastructure**
- Design template system architecture
- Create template registry and metadata format
- Implement template selection UI
- Build template installation engine
- Create 2-3 pilot templates for validation

**Phase 2: Template Library**
- Decide on framework coverage (to be determined during implementation)
- Create templates for selected frameworks
- Test each template thoroughly
- Document template creation process for future additions

**Phase 3: CI/CD Integration**
- Add CI/CD platform selection
- Create workflow generators for each platform
- Integrate with template installation
- Test generated workflows

**Phase 4: Advanced Features**
- Multi-language/monorepo templates
- Docker and container configurations
- IDE/editor integration
- Custom template creation guide for users

**Files Affected:**

**Modified:**
- `src/sdd/project/init.py` - Enhanced with template selection and installation
- `.claude/commands/init.md` - Updated documentation
- `src/sdd/quality/gates.py` - May need template-aware configuration loading

**New:**
- `src/sdd/templates/template_registry.json` - Template metadata
- `src/sdd/templates/<template-name>/` - Individual template directories
- `src/sdd/project/template_manager.py` - Template selection and installation logic
- `tests/unit/test_template_manager.py` - Template system tests
- `tests/e2e/test_template_init.py` - End-to-end template initialization tests

**Benefits:**

1. **Zero-configuration experience**: Everything works out of the box
2. **Fixes quality gate issues**: All tools and configs properly installed (solves --fix issue)
3. **Faster onboarding**: Reduces setup time from 10-20 minutes to < 1 minute
4. **Best practices baked in**: Framework-specific configurations optimized by experts
5. **CI/CD from day one**: Production-ready workflows included
6. **Reduces errors**: Eliminates configuration mistakes
7. **Extensible**: Easy to add new templates as frameworks evolve
8. **Supports all project types**: From simple single-language to complex monorepos

**Solves Existing Issues:**

- ✅ **Fixes Enhancement #12 concern**: Quality gates (including `--fix`) work immediately because all tools are properly configured
- ✅ **Better language detection**: Template explicitly declares language and tools
- ✅ **Framework awareness**: Quality gates know exactly which tools to use and how

**Priority:** High - Significantly improves developer experience and solves multiple pain points

**Notes:**

- Framework selection to be decided during implementation
- Template library can grow over time as community needs evolve
- Community could potentially contribute templates for additional frameworks
- Backward compatible: "Custom" option provides current behavior

### Enhancement #14: Session Briefing Optimization

**Status:** 🔵 IDENTIFIED

**Problem:**

Session briefings currently consume significant context window space and may not provide the most useful information for AI-assisted development. Potential issues include:

1. **Excessive context usage**: Briefings may include redundant or less relevant information
2. **Missing critical context**: Important architectural constraints or patterns might be omitted
3. **Inefficient information structure**: Data not organized for optimal AI consumption
4. **Lack of progressive disclosure**: All information presented upfront rather than contextually

**Proposed Solution:**

Research and optimize session briefing content and structure to:

1. **Maximize information value**: Include only the most relevant and actionable information
2. **Minimize context usage**: Compress or restructure data for efficiency
3. **Improve AI effectiveness**: Format information in ways that improve AI understanding
4. **Context-aware loading**: Load additional detail on-demand rather than upfront

**Implementation:**

To be researched and determined during implementation. May include:
- Analysis of current briefing content and usage patterns
- Identification of high-value vs low-value information
- Experimentation with different information structures
- Compression techniques for historical data
- Dynamic context loading strategies

**Files Affected:**

**Modified:**
- `src/sdd/session/start.py` - Session briefing generation
- `.claude/commands/start.md` - Start command documentation
- Briefing templates and data structures

**Benefits:**

1. **More context available**: Reduced briefing size leaves more room for code and docs
2. **Better AI assistance**: Higher quality information improves AI effectiveness
3. **Faster sessions**: Less time loading and processing briefing data
4. **Improved focus**: Only relevant information presented

**Priority:** High - Impacts every session and all future work

**Notes:**
- Details to be researched and refined during implementation
- May involve experimentation and iteration to find optimal approach
- Should measure context usage before and after optimization

### Enhancement #15: Pre-Merge Security Gates

**Status:** 🔵 IDENTIFIED

**Problem:**

Currently, security scans run at `/sdd:end`, but if they fail, code might already be committed to the branch. There's no enforcement mechanism to prevent merging insecure code to main. Critical security issues include:

1. **Secret exposure**: API keys, passwords, tokens accidentally committed
2. **Known vulnerabilities**: Dependencies with CVEs in production
3. **Code vulnerabilities**: SQL injection, XSS, insecure authentication patterns
4. **Supply chain attacks**: Malicious packages in dependencies
5. **License compliance**: Incompatible licenses that create legal risk

**Current Workflow Gap:**
```
Code written → /sdd:end → Security scan (may fail) → Commit to branch → Merge to main
                                                      ❌ No gate here
```

**Proposed Solution:**

Implement **mandatory pre-merge security gates** that prevent merging to main if critical security issues exist:

1. **Secret Scanning**
   - Scan for API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys
   - Tools: GitGuardian, TruffleHog, detect-secrets
   - Block merge if secrets detected

2. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**
   - Analyze code for security vulnerabilities
   - Check for SQL injection, XSS, insecure crypto, etc.
   - Tools: Bandit (Python), ESLint security plugins (JS/TS), Semgrep
   - Block merge if critical/high vulnerabilities found

3. **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning**
   - Check for known CVEs in dependencies
   - Tools: Safety (Python), npm audit (JS/TS), Snyk
   - Block merge if critical CVEs exist

4. **Supply Chain Security**
   - Detect malicious or compromised packages
   - Verify package signatures and checksums
   - Tools: Sigstore, Socket Security

5. **License Compliance**
   - Ensure dependencies use compatible licenses
   - Flag GPL in proprietary projects, etc.
   - Tools: license-checker, FOSSA

**Implementation:**

**Pre-merge hook (Git or CI/CD):**
```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-push or CI workflow
sdd security-scan --pre-merge
→ Runs all security checks
→ Exits with code 1 if critical issues found
→ Blocks push/merge
```

**Quality gate integration:**
```python
# src/sdd/quality/security_gates.py
def run_pre_merge_security_gates():
    results = {
        "secret_scan": run_secret_scanning(),
        "sast": run_static_analysis(),
        "dependencies": scan_dependencies(),
        "supply_chain": check_supply_chain(),
        "licenses": check_license_compliance()
    }
    return all_passed, results
```

**Files Affected:**

**New:**
- `src/sdd/security/secret_scanner.py` - Secret detection
- `src/sdd/security/sast_scanner.py` - Static analysis
- `src/sdd/security/dependency_scanner.py` - CVE checking
- `src/sdd/security/supply_chain_checker.py` - Package verification
- `src/sdd/security/license_checker.py` - License compliance
- `src/sdd/quality/security_gates.py` - Pre-merge gate orchestration
- `.git/hooks/pre-push` - Git hook for local enforcement
- Tests for all security modules

**Modified:**
- `src/sdd/session/complete.py` - Integrate pre-merge security gates
- `.session/config.json` - Add security gate configuration
- CI/CD workflows - Add security gate job

**Benefits:**

1. **Prevents secret leaks**: Catches credentials before they reach remote
2. **Blocks vulnerable code**: No critical security issues in production
3. **Supply chain protection**: Detects malicious dependencies
4. **Compliance assurance**: Legal risks from licenses caught early
5. **Developer awareness**: Immediate feedback on security issues
6. **Audit trail**: All security decisions documented

**Priority:** Critical - Security is foundational, must be enforced before anything reaches production

### Enhancement #16: Continuous Security Monitoring

**Status:** 🔵 IDENTIFIED

**Problem:**

Security is currently checked only during development sessions. Between sessions, new vulnerabilities may be discovered (CVEs published), and the codebase remains unmonitored. This creates a security gap:

1. **Zero-day vulnerabilities**: New CVEs published for existing dependencies
2. **Unmaintained dependencies**: Libraries deprecated or abandoned
3. **Drift from security best practices**: New security advisories not applied
4. **No proactive alerting**: Developer only finds issues when starting next session

**Current Gap:**
```
Session 1: Security scan ✓ → Time passes (days/weeks) → New CVE published! ❌ No alert
                                                       → Session 2: User unaware
```

**Proposed Solution:**

Implement **continuous security monitoring** that runs scheduled scans and alerts developers of new security issues:

1. **Scheduled CVE Scanning**
   - Daily/weekly scans for new CVEs in dependencies
   - Compare against CVE databases (NVD, GitHub Advisory)
   - Generate alerts for critical/high severity issues

2. **Dependency Update Monitoring**
   - Track security patches for dependencies
   - Automatically create work items for critical updates
   - Suggest safe update paths (minor vs major version changes)

3. **Security Advisory Notifications**
   - Subscribe to security advisories for frameworks used
   - Alert on new attack vectors or best practice changes
   - Generate remediation work items

4. **License Compliance Monitoring**
   - Track dependency license changes
   - Alert on new incompatible licenses
   - Monitor for license violations

**Implementation:**

**Scheduled monitoring (GitHub Actions, cron):**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/security-monitoring.yml
name: Security Monitoring
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * *'  # Daily at 9 AM
jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run security monitoring
        run: sdd security-monitor --create-work-items
```

**Monitoring system:**
```python
# src/sdd/security/monitor.py
class SecurityMonitor:
    def scan_for_new_cves(self):
        # Check dependencies against CVE databases

    def check_for_updates(self):
        # Find security updates for dependencies

    def create_security_work_items(self, findings):
        # Auto-create work items for critical issues

    def notify_developer(self, critical_issues):
        # Email/Slack notification
```

**Files Affected:**

**New:**
- `src/sdd/security/monitor.py` - Continuous monitoring system
- `src/sdd/security/cve_database.py` - CVE lookup and caching
- `src/sdd/security/advisory_tracker.py` - Security advisory tracking
- `.github/workflows/security-monitoring.yml` - Scheduled workflow
- Tests for monitoring system

**Modified:**
- `src/sdd/work_items/manager.py` - Auto-create security work items
- `.session/config.json` - Add monitoring configuration
- `src/sdd/notifications/` - Alert mechanisms (email, Slack)

**Benefits:**

1. **Proactive security**: Find vulnerabilities before attackers
2. **Zero-day protection**: Immediate alerts for new CVEs
3. **Reduced exposure window**: Faster response to security issues
4. **Automated remediation**: Work items auto-created
5. **Compliance**: Continuous license monitoring
6. **Peace of mind**: Always know security status

**Priority:** High - Continuous protection is essential for production systems

---

### Enhancement #17: Test Quality Gates

**Status:** 🔵 IDENTIFIED

**Problem:**

Currently, tests are required but there's no validation of test quality. This allows:

1. **Weak tests**: Tests that always pass regardless of code correctness
2. **Insufficient coverage**: Critical paths untested
3. **Missing test types**: No integration or E2E tests
4. **Performance regressions**: No performance test baseline
5. **Flaky tests**: Unreliable tests that randomly fail

**Example of weak tests:**
```python
def test_user_authentication():
    result = authenticate_user("user", "pass")
    assert result is not None  # ❌ Always passes even if auth is broken
```

**Current Gap:**
```
Tests written → All tests pass ✓ → Merge
                ❌ But tests might be weak or incomplete
```

**Proposed Solution:**

Implement **test quality gates** that enforce test effectiveness:

1. **Critical Path Coverage**
   - Identify critical paths (authentication, payment, data loss scenarios)
   - Require >90% coverage for critical paths
   - Tools: coverage.py with path analysis, Istanbul

2. **Mutation Testing**
   - Inject bugs into code, ensure tests catch them
   - Mutation score must meet threshold (e.g., >75%)
   - Tools: Stryker (JS/TS), mutmut (Python)

3. **Integration Test Requirements**
   - Require integration tests for multi-component features
   - Validate data flow across components
   - Minimum number of integration tests per work item type

4. **E2E Test Requirements** (for web apps)
   - Require E2E tests for user-facing features
   - Validate complete user workflows
   - Tools: Playwright, Cypress, Selenium

5. **Performance Regression Tests**
   - Establish performance baselines
   - Fail if performance degrades beyond threshold (e.g., >10% slower)
   - Track response times, throughput, resource usage

6. **Test Reliability (Flakiness Detection)**
   - Detect flaky tests (inconsistent pass/fail)
   - Quarantine flaky tests
   - Require fixing before merge

**Implementation:**

**Test quality gate:**
```python
# src/sdd/quality/test_quality_gates.py
class TestQualityGates:
    def check_critical_path_coverage(self, work_item):
        # Verify critical paths have >90% coverage

    def run_mutation_testing(self):
        # Run mutation tests, check score

    def validate_integration_tests(self, work_item):
        # Ensure integration tests exist

    def check_e2e_tests(self, work_item):
        # For UI work items, verify E2E tests

    def check_performance_regression(self):
        # Compare against baseline
```

**Work item spec integration:**
```markdown
## Testing Requirements

**Critical Paths:** (auto-detected or specified)
- User authentication flow
- Payment processing
- Data backup/restore

**Required Test Types:**
- [x] Unit tests (>85% coverage)
- [x] Integration tests (≥3 scenarios)
- [x] E2E tests (main user workflow)
- [x] Performance tests (baseline established)

**Mutation Score Target:** 75%
```

**Files Affected:**

**New:**
- `src/sdd/quality/test_quality_gates.py` - Test quality validation
- `src/sdd/testing/mutation_runner.py` - Mutation testing integration
- `src/sdd/testing/critical_path_analyzer.py` - Critical path identification
- `src/sdd/testing/flakiness_detector.py` - Flaky test detection
- `src/sdd/testing/performance_baseline.py` - Performance tracking
- Tests for all test quality modules

**Modified:**
- `src/sdd/session/complete.py` - Add test quality gates
- `src/sdd/work_items/spec_parser.py` - Parse testing requirements
- `.session/config.json` - Test quality thresholds

**Benefits:**

1. **Confidence in tests**: Know tests actually catch bugs
2. **Prevents regressions**: Performance baselines protect against degradation
3. **Complete coverage**: All test types required
4. **Reliable builds**: No flaky tests breaking CI
5. **Quality assurance**: Tests verified to be effective

**Priority:** High - Quality tests are essential for reliable software

### Enhancement #18: Advanced Code Quality Gates

**Status:** 🔵 IDENTIFIED

**Problem:**

Current linting only catches basic style issues. Complex code quality problems go undetected:

1. **High complexity**: Functions with cyclomatic complexity >10 are hard to maintain
2. **Code duplication**: Copy-pasted code creates maintenance burden
3. **Dead code**: Unused functions and imports waste space and create confusion
4. **Weak typing**: TypeScript without strict mode allows bugs

**Example:**
```python
def process_order(order):  # Complexity: 23 ❌ Too complex
    if order.status == "pending":
        if order.payment_method == "card":
            if order.card_valid:
                if order.inventory_available:
                    # ... 50 more lines of nested ifs
```

**Current Gap:**
```
Linting passes ✓ → Merge
❌ Complex, duplicated, dead code still merges
```

**Proposed Solution:**

Implement **advanced code quality gates** that enforce maintainability:

1. **Cyclomatic Complexity Enforcement**
   - Fail if function complexity >10
   - Suggest breaking down complex functions
   - Tools: radon (Python), complexity-report (JS/TS)

2. **Code Duplication Detection**
   - Detect copy-pasted code blocks
   - Fail if duplication >5% of codebase
   - Tools: jscpd, pylint duplicate-code

3. **Dead Code Detection**
   - Find unused functions, classes, imports
   - Require removal before merge
   - Tools: vulture (Python), ts-prune (TypeScript)

4. **Type Coverage Enforcement** (TypeScript)
   - Require strict mode in tsconfig.json
   - Fail if `any` types used without justification
   - Measure type coverage percentage

5. **Cognitive Complexity**
   - Measure how hard code is to understand
   - Complement cyclomatic complexity
   - Tools: SonarQube, CodeClimate

6. **Code Documentation Standards**
   - Enforce documentation for public APIs, classes, and functions
   - Validate docstring/JSDoc completeness and quality
   - Require parameter and return type documentation
   - Check for outdated documentation (code changes without doc updates)
   - Generate missing documentation warnings
   - Tools: pydocstyle, JSDoc validation, custom documentation linters

**Implementation:**

**Code quality gate:**
```python
# src/sdd/quality/code_quality_gates.py
class CodeQualityGates:
    def check_complexity(self, file_changes):
        # Analyze cyclomatic complexity
        # Fail if any function >10

    def detect_duplication(self):
        # Scan for code duplication
        # Fail if >5% duplicated

    def find_dead_code(self):
        # Detect unused code
        # Report for removal

    def check_type_coverage(self):
        # For TypeScript: verify strict mode
        # Check for excessive `any` usage

    def validate_documentation(self, file_changes):
        # Check for missing docstrings/JSDoc
        # Validate documentation completeness
        # Detect outdated documentation
        # Generate documentation warnings
```

**Configuration:**
```json
// .session/config.json
"code_quality_gates": {
  "complexity": {
    "enabled": true,
    "max_complexity": 10,
    "max_cognitive_complexity": 15

### Enhancement #19: Production Readiness Gates

**Status:** 🔵 IDENTIFIED

**Problem:**

Code may pass all tests but still not be ready for production. Production-specific requirements are not validated:

1. **No health checks**: Can't monitor service health
2. **No observability**: Can't debug production issues
3. **No error tracking**: Errors silently fail
4. **Inconsistent logging**: Can't trace requests
5. **Unsafe migrations**: Database changes cause downtime

**Example of production failure:**
```
All tests pass ✓ → Deploy to production → Service starts
                                        → Health check missing ❌
                                        → Load balancer can't detect failures
                                        → Site down, no alerts
```

**Proposed Solution:**

Implement **production readiness gates** that validate operational requirements:

1. **Health Check Endpoints**
   - Require `/health` and `/ready` endpoints
   - Validate they return proper status codes
   - Test health check logic actually works

2. **Metrics and Observability**
   - Require `/metrics` endpoint (Prometheus format)
   - Validate metrics exported (request count, latency, errors)
   - Ensure distributed tracing configured (OpenTelemetry)

3. **Error Tracking Integration**
   - Require error tracking setup (Sentry, Rollbar, etc.)
   - Validate errors are captured and reported
   - Test error grouping and notification

4. **Structured Logging**
   - Enforce structured logging (JSON format)
   - Require correlation IDs for request tracing
   - Validate log levels appropriate

5. **Database Migration Safety**
   - Require reversible migrations
   - Test migrations on staging data
   - Validate migration doesn't cause downtime

6. **Configuration Management**
   - All config via environment variables
   - No secrets in code or version control
   - Validate required env vars documented

**Implementation:**

**Production readiness gate:**
```python
# src/sdd/quality/production_gates.py
class ProductionReadinessGates:
    def validate_health_endpoints(self):
        # Check /health and /ready exist
        # Test they return 200

    def validate_metrics(self):
        # Check /metrics endpoint
        # Validate metrics format

    def validate_error_tracking(self):
        # Verify error tracking configured
        # Test error capture works

    def validate_logging(self):
        # Check structured logging
        # Verify correlation IDs

    def validate_migrations(self):
        # Test migrations reversible
        # Validate no downtime
```

**Work item checklist for deployment:**
```markdown
## Production Readiness

- [x] Health check endpoints implemented and tested
- [x] Metrics exported (Prometheus format)
- [x] Error tracking configured and tested
- [x] Structured logging with correlation IDs
- [x] Database migrations tested and reversible
- [x] Required environment variables documented
- [x] Secrets managed via secrets manager (not in code)
```

**Files Affected:**

**New:**
- `src/sdd/quality/production_gates.py` - Production readiness validation
- `src/sdd/production/health_check_validator.py` - Health check testing
- `src/sdd/production/metrics_validator.py` - Metrics validation
- `src/sdd/production/migration_validator.py` - Migration safety checks
- Tests for production validation

**Modified:**
- `src/sdd/session/complete.py` - Add production gates for deployment work items
- `src/sdd/work_items/templates/deployment.md` - Add production checklist
- `.session/config.json` - Production requirements configuration

**Benefits:**

1. **Operational visibility**: Always know service health
2. **Faster debugging**: Logs and traces available
3. **Proactive alerting**: Errors tracked and reported
4. **Safe deployments**: Migrations tested and reversible
5. **Production confidence**: All operational needs met

**Priority:** High - Essential for production deployments

### Enhancement #20: Deployment Safety Gates

**Status:** 🔵 IDENTIFIED

**Problem:**

Deployments can fail or cause outages even with good code:

1. **Untested deployments**: Deployment procedure never practiced
2. **Breaking changes**: API changes break clients
3. **No rollback plan**: Can't revert if deployment fails
4. **Risky releases**: All changes deployed at once

**Example of deployment failure:**
```
Code ready → Deploy to production → API change breaks mobile app
                                  → No rollback procedure ❌
                                  → Site down for hours
```

**Proposed Solution:**

Implement **deployment safety gates** that validate deployment readiness:

1. **Deployment Dry-Run**
   - Test deployment procedure in staging
   - Validate all deployment steps work
   - Ensure no manual steps required

2. **Breaking Change Detection**
   - Detect API changes (endpoints removed, fields changed)
   - Validate backward compatibility
   - Require versioning for breaking changes
   - Tools: OpenAPI diff, GraphQL schema comparison

3. **Rollback Testing**
   - Test rollback procedure before deployment
   - Validate rollback completes successfully
   - Document rollback steps

4. **Canary Deployment Support**
   - Gradual rollout to small percentage of users
   - Monitor metrics during rollout
   - Automatic rollback if errors spike

5. **Smoke Tests**
   - Run smoke tests after deployment
   - Validate critical paths work
   - Automatic rollback if smoke tests fail

**Implementation:**

**Deployment safety gate:**
```python
# src/sdd/deployment/safety_gates.py
class DeploymentSafetyGates:
    def run_dry_run(self, deployment_config):
        # Test deployment in staging

    def detect_breaking_changes(self):
        # Compare API schemas
        # Detect breaking changes

    def test_rollback(self):
        # Execute rollback procedure
        # Validate success

    def setup_canary(self, percentage):
        # Configure canary deployment
        # Set up monitoring

    def run_smoke_tests(self):
        # Execute smoke tests
        # Return results
```

**Deployment workflow:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
jobs:
  pre-deployment:
    - Dry-run in staging
    - Detect breaking changes
    - Test rollback procedure

  deploy:
    - Canary to 5% of users
    - Monitor for 10 minutes
    - If metrics good, continue
    - If errors spike, rollback
    - Gradually increase to 100%

  post-deployment:
    - Run smoke tests
    - Verify health checks
    - Monitor for issues
```

**Files Affected:**

**New:**
- `src/sdd/deployment/safety_gates.py` - Deployment validation
- `src/sdd/deployment/dry_run.py` - Dry-run execution
- `src/sdd/deployment/breaking_change_detector.py` - API diff analysis
- `src/sdd/deployment/rollback_tester.py` - Rollback validation
- `src/sdd/deployment/canary.py` - Canary deployment orchestration
- `src/sdd/deployment/smoke_tests.py` - Smoke test runner
- Tests for deployment safety

**Modified:**
- CI/CD workflows - Add deployment gates
- `src/sdd/work_items/templates/deployment.md` - Add safety checklist
- `.session/config.json` - Deployment safety configuration

**Benefits:**

1. **Safe deployments**: Tested before production
2. **No breaking changes**: Backward compatibility validated
3. **Quick recovery**: Rollback always available
4. **Gradual rollouts**: Canary reduces risk
5. **Confidence**: Deploy without fear

**Priority:** High - Essential for production stability

### Enhancement #21: Documentation-Driven Development

**Status:** 🔵 IDENTIFIED

**Problem:**

The AI-Augmented Solo Framework assumes developers start with Vision, PRD, and Architecture documents, but SDD currently has no workflow to:

1. **Parse project documentation**: Vision, PRD, Architecture docs exist but aren't used
2. **Generate work items from docs**: Manual work item creation from 100+ page docs is tedious
3. **Maintain doc-code traceability**: No link between code and original requirements
4. **Track architecture decisions**: ADRs not captured or tracked
5. **Validate against architecture**: Work items may violate architecture constraints

**Example workflow gap:**
```
Developer has:
  - Vision.md (product vision)
  - PRD.md (requirements, 50 pages)
  - Architecture.md (system design)

Current process:
  → Manually read all docs
  → Manually create work items
  → Hope work items align with architecture
  → No traceability between code and requirements
```

**Proposed Solution:**

Implement **documentation-driven development workflow** that parses project docs and guides development:

1. **Document Parsing and Analysis**
   - Parse Vision, PRD, Architecture, ADR documents
   - Extract requirements, user stories, architectural constraints
   - Build knowledge graph of project structure

2. **Smart Work Item Generation**
   - Analyze documents and suggest work items
   - Prioritize based on dependencies and business value
   - Map work items to architecture components
   - Estimate complexity from requirements

3. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**
   - Template-based ADR creation
   - Link ADRs to work items
   - Track decision history and rationale
   - Validate work items against ADRs

4. **Document-to-Code Traceability**
   - Link work items to requirements in docs
   - Track which code implements which requirement
   - Generate traceability matrix

5. **Architecture Validation**
   - Validate work items against architecture constraints
   - Detect architecture violations
   - Suggest architecture updates when needed

6. **API-First Documentation System**
   - Automated OpenAPI/Swagger generation from code annotations
   - Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI, Redoc, API Explorer)
   - API versioning and changelog automation
   - SDK generation for multiple languages (Python, TypeScript, Go, etc.)
   - API contract testing integration
   - Breaking change detection between API versions
   - API usage analytics and deprecation management

**Implementation:**

**Document parser:**
```python
# src/sdd/docs/parser.py
class DocumentParser:
    def parse_vision(self, vision_file):
        # Extract business goals, target users

    def parse_prd(self, prd_file):
        # Extract requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria

    def parse_architecture(self, arch_file):
        # Extract components, constraints, patterns

    def parse_adrs(self, adr_dir):
        # Load all ADRs, build decision history
```

**Work item generator:**
```python
# src/sdd/work_items/generator.py
class WorkItemGenerator:
    def suggest_from_documents(self, docs):
        # Analyze docs, extract requirements
        # Generate work item suggestions
        # Prioritize and estimate

    def map_to_architecture(self, work_items, architecture):
        # Map work items to arch components
        # Validate against constraints
```

**API documentation generator:**
```python
# src/sdd/docs/api_doc_generator.py
class APIDocumentationGenerator:
    def generate_openapi_spec(self, codebase):
        # Scan code for API endpoints and annotations
        # Generate OpenAPI 3.0 specification
        # Include schemas, parameters, responses

    def generate_interactive_docs(self, openapi_spec):
        # Generate Swagger UI / Redoc documentation
        # Set up API explorer with try-it-out functionality
        # Deploy to docs site

    def generate_sdk(self, openapi_spec, languages):
        # Generate client SDKs from OpenAPI spec
        # Support Python, TypeScript, Go, Java, etc.
        # Include usage examples and tests

    def detect_breaking_changes(self, old_spec, new_spec):
        # Compare API versions
        # Identify breaking changes (removed endpoints, changed schemas)
        # Generate migration guide

    def track_api_versions(self):
        # Maintain API version history
        # Generate changelogs automatically
        # Mark deprecated endpoints
```

### Enhancement #22: Performance Testing Framework

**Status:** 🔵 IDENTIFIED

**Problem:**

Performance issues are discovered in production, not development:

1. **No performance baselines**: Don't know expected performance
2. **No load testing**: System untested under realistic load
3. **No regression detection**: Performance degradations unnoticed
4. **No bottleneck identification**: Slow endpoints unknown

**Example:**
```
Feature added → All tests pass ✓ → Deploy
                                 → Production: 5s response times ❌
                                 → Users complain
                                 → No baseline to compare
```

**Proposed Solution:**

Implement **comprehensive performance testing framework**:

1. **Performance Benchmarks in Specs**
   - Define performance requirements in work items
   - Example: "API must respond in <200ms at p95"
   - Enforce benchmarks before merge

2. **Automated Load Testing**
   - Run load tests in CI/CD
   - Tools: k6, wrk, Gatling, Locust
   - Test realistic traffic patterns

3. **Performance Regression Detection**
   - Compare results against baseline
   - Fail if performance degrades >10%
   - Track performance over time

4. **Bottleneck Identification**
   - Profile slow endpoints
   - Identify database query issues
   - Find N+1 queries, missing indexes

5. **Performance Baseline Tracking**
   - Store baselines in `.session/tracking/performance_baselines.json`
   - Update baselines when performance improves
   - Historical performance charts

**Implementation:**

**Performance spec in work item:**
```markdown
## Performance Requirements

**Response Time Targets:**
- GET /api/users: <100ms (p50), <200ms (p95)
- POST /api/orders: <500ms (p50), <1s (p95)
- Database queries: <50ms average

**Throughput Targets:**
- 1000 requests/second sustained
- 5000 concurrent users

**Resource Limits:**
- Memory: <512MB
- CPU: <50% average
```

**Load testing:**
```python
# src/sdd/performance/load_tester.py
class LoadTester:
    def run_load_test(self, work_item):
        # Extract performance requirements
        # Run k6/wrk load test
        # Compare against baseline
        # Return pass/fail + metrics

    def detect_regression(self, current, baseline):
        # Compare metrics
        # Fail if >10% slower
```

**k6 test generation:**
```javascript
// tests/performance/api_test.js (auto-generated)
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '2m', target: 100 },  // Ramp to 100 users
    { duration: '5m', target: 100 },  // Stay at 100
    { duration: '2m', target: 0 },    // Ramp down
  ],
  thresholds: {
    'http_req_duration': ['p(95)<200'],  // 95% requests <200ms
  },
};

export default function() {
  let res = http.get('http://localhost:3000/api/users');
  check(res, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'response time OK': (r) => r.timings.duration < 200,
  });
}
```

**Baseline tracking:**
```json
// .session/tracking/performance_baselines.json
{
  "endpoints": {
    "/api/users": {
      "p50": 85,
      "p95": 180,
      "last_updated": "2025-10-29",
      "session": "session_015"
    }
  }
}
```

- `.session/config.json` - Performance testing configuration
- CI/CD workflows - Add performance testing job

**Benefits:**

1. **Prevent regressions**: Catch slowdowns before production
2. **Meet SLAs**: Enforce performance requirements
3. **Capacity planning**: Know system limits
4. **Bottleneck identification**: Find and fix slow code
5. **Performance visibility**: Track performance over time

**Priority:** High - Performance issues cause production incidents

### Enhancement #23: Operations & Observability

**Status:** 🔵 IDENTIFIED

**Problem:**

After deployment, there's no operational support infrastructure:

1. **No health monitoring**: Can't tell if service is healthy
2. **No incident detection**: Issues discovered by users, not monitoring
3. **No performance dashboards**: Can't see system performance
4. **No capacity planning**: Don't know when to scale
5. **No alert management**: Alerts missing or too noisy

**Example:**
```
Deploy to production ✓ → Service running
                      → Database runs out of connections ❌
                      → No alert
                      → Users report errors
                      → 2 hours to discover issue
```

**Proposed Solution:**

Implement **comprehensive operations and observability infrastructure**:

1. **Health Check Monitoring**
   - Monitor `/health` endpoint continuously
   - Alert on failures
   - Track uptime metrics
   - Integration with UptimeRobot, Pingdom, Datadog

2. **Incident Detection and Response**
   - Automatic incident creation on alerts
   - Incident runbooks linked to alerts
   - PagerDuty/Opsgenie integration
   - Incident timeline and resolution tracking

3. **Performance Metrics Dashboards**
   - Real-time metrics visualization
   - Request rates, latency, error rates
   - Database performance metrics
   - Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
   - Tools: Grafana, Datadog, New Relic

4. **Capacity Planning**
   - Track resource usage trends
   - Predict when scaling needed
   - Cost optimization recommendations
   - Alert on approaching limits

5. **Intelligent Alerting**
   - Reduce alert noise (no alert fatigue)
   - Alert prioritization (critical vs warning)
   - Alert aggregation and correlation
   - Alert routing and escalation

**Implementation:**

**Health monitoring:**
```python
# src/sdd/operations/health_monitor.py
class HealthMonitor:
    def setup_monitoring(self, endpoints):
        # Configure health check monitoring
        # Set up alerts

    def check_health(self):
        # Poll health endpoints
        # Detect failures
        # Create incidents
```

**Incident management:**
```python
# src/sdd/operations/incident_manager.py
class IncidentManager:
    def create_incident(self, alert):
        # Create incident from alert
        # Link to runbook
        # Notify on-call

    def track_incident(self, incident_id):
        # Track resolution steps
        # Update timeline
```

**Dashboards:**
```yaml
# monitoring/dashboards/api_dashboard.yml
dashboard:
  title: "API Performance"
  panels:
    - title: "Request Rate"
      metric: "http_requests_total"
    - title: "Response Time (p95)"
      metric: "http_request_duration_p95"
    - title: "Error Rate"
      metric: "http_errors_total / http_requests_total"
    - title: "Database Connections"
      metric: "db_connections_active"
```

**Alert configuration:**
```yaml
# monitoring/alerts/api_alerts.yml
alerts:
  - name: "High Error Rate"
    condition: "error_rate > 5%"
    severity: "critical"
    notify: ["email", "pagerduty"]

  - name: "Slow Response Time"
    condition: "p95_latency > 1s"
    severity: "warning"
    notify: ["email"]

  - name: "Database Connection Pool Exhausted"
    condition: "db_connections > 90%"
    severity: "critical"
    runbook: "docs/runbooks/db_connections.md"
```

### Enhancement #24: Continuous Improvement System

**Status:** 🔵 IDENTIFIED

**Problem:**

Development processes don't improve over time. No mechanism to:

1. **Learn from work items**: Patterns and lessons lost
2. **Track technical debt**: Debt accumulates unnoticed
3. **Measure velocity**: Don't know if getting faster or slower
4. **Identify bottlenecks**: Process inefficiencies unknown
5. **Optimize workflows**: No data-driven improvements

**Example:**
```
Work item completed → Next work item started
                    → No reflection on what worked/didn't work
                    → Same issues repeat
                    → No improvement
```

**Proposed Solution:**

Implement **continuous improvement system** that tracks metrics and suggests optimizations:

1. **Automated Retrospectives**
   - After each work item or milestone, generate retrospective
   - Analyze what went well, what didn't
   - Track lessons learned
   - Suggest improvements

2. **Technical Debt Tracking**
   - Identify technical debt during development
   - Track debt accumulation over time
   - Prioritize debt paydown
   - Measure debt ratio

3. **DORA Metrics Dashboard**
   - Deployment frequency: How often deploying
   - Lead time: Time from commit to production
   - Change failure rate: % of deployments that fail
   - Mean time to recovery (MTTR): Time to fix production issues

4. **Velocity and Cycle Time Tracking**
   - Track work item completion time
   - Measure velocity (story points/week)
   - Identify slowdowns
   - Trend analysis

5. **Process Optimization Recommendations**
   - Analyze bottlenecks in workflow
   - Suggest process improvements
   - A/B test process changes
   - Measure impact of improvements

**Implementation:**

**Retrospective generator:**
```python
# src/sdd/improvement/retrospective.py
class RetrospectiveGenerator:
    def generate_retrospective(self, work_item):
        # Analyze work item history
        # Generate retrospective questions
        # Track patterns

    def suggest_improvements(self, retrospectives):
        # Analyze multiple retrospectives
        # Identify recurring issues
        # Suggest improvements
```

**Technical debt tracker:**
```python
# src/sdd/improvement/debt_tracker.py
class TechnicalDebtTracker:
    def identify_debt(self, codebase):

        # Find TODOs and FIXMEs
        # Measure code complexity

    def calculate_debt_ratio(self):
        # Debt ratio = debt / total code
        # Track over time
```

**DORA metrics:**
```python
# src/sdd/improvement/dora_metrics.py
class DORAMetrics:
    def deployment_frequency(self):
        # Count deployments per day/week

    def lead_time(self):
        # Time from commit to production

    def change_failure_rate(self):
        # Failed deployments / total deployments

    def mean_time_to_recovery(self):
        # Average time to fix production issues
```

**Dashboard:**
```markdown
# /sdd:status --project

## DORA Metrics
- Deployment Frequency: 3.2/week (↑ from 2.5)
- Lead Time: 2.3 days (↓ from 3.1 days)
- Change Failure Rate: 8% (target: <15%)
- MTTR: 1.2 hours (↓ from 2.5 hours)

## Velocity
- Current: 21 story points/week
- Trend: ↑ 15% over last month
- Average cycle time: 2.1 days

## Technical Debt
- Debt Ratio: 12% (target: <15%)
- High-priority debt items: 3
- Debt added this week: 2 items
- Debt resolved this week: 4 items

## Process Insights
- Bottleneck: Integration testing (avg 45 min)
- Suggestion: Parallelize integration tests
- Improvement opportunity: Automate deployment rollback
```

**Retrospective format:**
```markdown
# Retrospective: feature_user_authentication

**What Went Well:**
- TDD approach caught edge cases early
- Performance testing revealed bottleneck before production
- Documentation was comprehensive

**What Didn't Go Well:**
- Integration tests took 45 minutes (too slow)
- Had to refactor authentication logic twice
- Missing error handling for edge case

**Lessons Learned:**
- Always consider rate limiting from the start
- Test with realistic data volumes

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Speed up integration tests (parallelize)

### Enhancement #25: Advanced Testing Types

**Status:** 🔵 IDENTIFIED

**Problem:**

Basic unit and integration tests don't catch all issues:

1. **Mutation testing**: Tests may pass even if they don't catch bugs
2. **Contract testing**: API changes break clients unexpectedly
3. **Accessibility testing**: WCAG compliance not validated
4. **Visual regression**: UI changes undetected

**Example:**
```
API change: Remove field "user.email"
  → Unit tests pass ✓ (don't test this field)
  → Integration tests pass ✓ (don't use this field)
  → Deploy
  → Mobile app breaks ❌ (depends on user.email)
```

**Proposed Solution:**

Implement **advanced testing types** that catch issues traditional tests miss:

1. **Mutation Testing**
   - Inject bugs into code (mutants)
   - Verify tests catch the bugs
   - Mutation score = % mutants killed
   - Tools: Stryker (JS/TS), mutmut (Python)

2. **Contract Testing**
   - Define API contracts
   - Test provider adheres to contract
   - Test consumer expectations met
   - Detect breaking changes early
   - Tools: Pact, Spring Cloud Contract

3. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Validate WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Test screen reader compatibility
   - Check color contrast
   - Tools: axe-core, Pa11y, Lighthouse

4. **Visual Regression Testing**
   - Capture screenshots of UI
   - Compare against baseline
   - Detect unintended visual changes
   - Tools: Percy, Chromatic, BackstopJS

**Implementation:**

**Mutation testing:**
```python
# src/sdd/testing/mutation_tester.py
class MutationTester:
    def run_mutation_tests(self, test_suite):
        # Run Stryker or mutmut
        # Generate mutants
        # Check if tests kill mutants
        # Calculate mutation score

    def check_mutation_score(self, score, threshold):
        # Fail if score < threshold (e.g., 75%)
```

**Contract testing:**
```python
# src/sdd/testing/contract_tester.py
class ContractTester:
    def define_contract(self, api_spec):
        # Create Pact contract from OpenAPI spec

    def test_provider(self, contract):
        # Verify API adheres to contract

    def test_consumer(self, contract):
        # Verify client expectations met

    def detect_breaking_changes(self, old_contract, new_contract):
        # Compare contracts, find breaking changes
```

**Accessibility testing:**
```python
# src/sdd/testing/accessibility_tester.py
class AccessibilityTester:
    def run_axe_audit(self, url):
        # Run axe-core accessibility audit
        # Return violations

    def check_wcag_compliance(self, violations):
        # Verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
        # Fail if critical violations
```

**Visual regression:**
```python
# src/sdd/testing/visual_tester.py
class VisualTester:
    def capture_screenshots(self, urls):
        # Capture screenshots of pages

    def compare_with_baseline(self, screenshots):
        # Compare with baseline images
        # Detect differences

    def update_baseline(self, screenshots):
        # Update baseline on approval
```

**Configuration:**
```json
// .session/config.json
"advanced_testing": {
  "mutation_testing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "threshold": 75,
    "framework": "stryker"  // or "mutmut"

### Enhancement #26: UAT & Stakeholder Workflow

**Status:** 🔵 IDENTIFIED

**Problem:**

No workflow for stakeholder feedback and user acceptance testing:

1. **No stakeholder involvement**: Stakeholders see features only at launch
2. **No UAT process**: No formal user acceptance testing
3. **No demo environments**: Difficult to show work in progress
4. **No approval workflow**: No sign-off before production

**Example:**
```
Feature built → Tests pass ✓ → Deploy to production

### Enhancement #29: Disaster Recovery & Backup Automation

**Status:** 🔵 IDENTIFIED

**Problem:**

Production systems lack comprehensive disaster recovery and backup automation:

1. **No automated backups**: Critical data loss risk if manual backups forgotten
2. **Untested recovery procedures**: Backups may be corrupt or incomplete
3. **No disaster recovery plan**: No documented procedure for system restoration
4. **No data retention policies**: Old backups accumulate or critical data deleted too soon
5. **Single point of failure**: No geographic redundancy or failover capability

**Example of failure:**

```
Production running → Database corruption ❌
                   → No recent backup
                   → Or backup exists but restore untested
                   → Or backup incomplete (missing files/secrets)
                   → Hours/days of data loss

**Recovery Procedure**:
1. Stop application servers (prevent further corruption)
2. Identify last known good backup
3. Restore database from backup: `sdd dr restore-database --backup-id <id>`
4. Replay transaction logs from backup point to current
5. Verify data integrity: `sdd dr verify-database`
6. Restart application servers
7. Monitor for errors
**Estimated Recovery Time**: 30 minutes

### Scenario 2: Complete Infrastructure Loss
**Detection**: All services unreachable
**Recovery Procedure**:
1. Activate secondary region: `sdd dr activate-failover --region us-west-2`
2. Restore infrastructure: `sdd dr restore-infrastructure --backup-id <id>`
3. Restore database: `sdd dr restore-database --backup-id <id> --region us-west-2`

### Enhancement #30: Compliance & Regulatory Framework

**Status:** 🔵 IDENTIFIED

**Problem:**

Projects handling sensitive data must comply with various regulations, but there's no automated compliance tracking:

1. **No compliance validation**: GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS requirements not checked
2. **Data privacy gaps**: Personal data handling not tracked or validated
3. **Audit trail missing**: No comprehensive logging for compliance audits
4. **Manual compliance checks**: Time-consuming and error-prone manual verification
5. **Regulation changes**: No monitoring for updates to compliance requirements

**Example of compliance failure:**

```
Collect user data → Store in database → Deploy
                                      → GDPR audit ❌
                                      → Missing: consent tracking, data export, deletion
                                      → Fines and legal issues
                                      → Damage to reputation

### Enhancement #31: Cost & Resource Optimization

**Status:** 🔵 IDENTIFIED

**Problem:**

Cloud costs can spiral out of control without monitoring and optimization:

1. **No cost visibility**: Don't know where money is being spent
2. **Resource waste**: Over-provisioned or unused resources
3. **No budget alerts**: Costs exceed budget without warning
4. **Inefficient architecture**: Expensive architectures when cheaper alternatives exist
5. **No optimization recommendations**: Manual cost optimization is time-consuming

**Example of cost waste:**

```
Deploy application → Runs for 6 months
                   → Database over-provisioned (90% idle)
                   → Load balancer for single instance
                   → Storage full of old logs
                   → Monthly cost: $1,200
                   → Optimized cost could be: $300
                   → Wasted: $900/month = $10,800/year
```

**Proposed Solution:**

Implement **cost and resource optimization framework** for monitoring and reducing cloud costs:

1. **Cost Monitoring & Visibility**
   - Real-time cost tracking per service
   - Cost allocation by project/environment/feature
   - Cost trend analysis and forecasting
   - Budget tracking and alerts
   - Multi-cloud cost aggregation (AWS, GCP, Azure)

2. **Resource Utilization Analysis**
   - Identify under-utilized resources
   - Track resource usage patterns
   - Detect idle or unused resources
   - Analyze peak vs average utilization
   - Right-sizing recommendations

3. **Automated Cost Optimization**
   - Auto-scaling based on actual usage
   - Spot instance recommendations
   - Reserved instance analysis
   - Storage tier optimization (hot/warm/cold)
   - Automated cleanup of unused resources

4. **Cost Optimization Recommendations**
   - Alternative architecture suggestions
   - Service tier optimization
   - Region cost comparisons
   - Commitment discount opportunities
   - Open-source alternative suggestions

5. **Budget Management**
   - Set budget limits per environment
   - Automated alerts on threshold breach
   - Spending forecasts
   - Cost anomaly detection
   - Automated resource shutdown on budget exceeded

        # Check if costs exceed budget
        # Send alerts to configured channels
        # Trigger automated actions if needed
```

**Resource optimizer:**
```python
# src/sdd/cost/resource_optimizer.py
class ResourceOptimizer:
    def identify_underutilized_resources(self):
        # Analyze CPU, memory, disk usage
        # Identify resources with <30% utilization
        # Calculate potential savings

    def recommend_rightsizing(self, resource):
        # Analyze historical usage patterns
        # Recommend appropriate instance types
        # Calculate cost savings

    def find_idle_resources(self):
        # Identify stopped instances still incurring costs
        # Find unused load balancers, IPs, volumes
        # Estimate monthly waste

    def optimize_storage_tiers(self):
        # Analyze storage access patterns
        # Recommend tier migrations (hot → cold)
        # Calculate storage cost savings
```

**Cost optimization engine:**
```python
# src/sdd/cost/optimization_engine.py
class CostOptimizationEngine:
    def recommend_spot_instances(self):
        # Identify workloads suitable for spot instances
        # Calculate potential savings (60-90% off)
        # Provide migration guide

    def analyze_reserved_instances(self):
        # Compare on-demand vs reserved pricing
        # Recommend reservation commitments
        # Calculate breakeven point

    def suggest_architectural_changes(self):
        # Identify expensive patterns
        # Suggest cheaper alternatives
