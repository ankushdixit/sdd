# SDD Roadmap

**Current Version:** v0.6.0 (Production-Ready)
**Status:** Core features complete, PyPI publishing next

---

## Project Journey

### Completed Phases (v0.0 ‚Üí v0.6.0)

SDD has achieved all core functionality through a series of focused development phases:

#### **Phase 0-1: Foundation (v0.0 - v0.1)**
‚úÖ **Core session workflow** with `/init`, `/start`, `/end`, `/validate`
‚úÖ **Stack & tree tracking** - Automatic technology and structure detection
‚úÖ **Git integration** - Branch management, commit automation, merge handling
‚úÖ **Comprehensive context loading** - Project docs, stack, tree in briefings

#### **Phase 2-3: Work Item System (v0.2 - v0.3)**
‚úÖ **Full work item management** - Create, list, show, update, track
‚úÖ **6 work item types** - Feature, bug, refactor, security, integration_test, deployment
‚úÖ **Dependency resolution** - Smart work item ordering, critical path analysis
‚úÖ **Milestone tracking** - Group and track progress across work items
‚úÖ **Dependency graph visualization** - ASCII, DOT, SVG formats with bottleneck detection

#### **Phase 4: Learning System (v0.4)**
‚úÖ **Learning capture** - Record insights during sessions
‚úÖ **Auto-categorization** - 6 categories (architecture, gotchas, best practices, etc.)
‚úÖ **Similarity detection** - Automatic duplicate merging (Jaccard + containment)
‚úÖ **Multi-source extraction** - From session summaries, git commits, inline comments
‚úÖ **Browsing & search** - Filter by category, tag, date, with statistics

#### **Phase 5: Quality & Validation (v0.5 - v0.5.7)**
‚úÖ **Quality gates** - Test execution, coverage, security scanning, linting, formatting
‚úÖ **Multi-language support** - Python, JavaScript, TypeScript throughout
‚úÖ **Integration testing support** - Docker orchestration, performance benchmarks, API validation
‚úÖ **Deployment support** - Environment validation, rollback automation, smoke tests
‚úÖ **Spec-first architecture** - Spec files as single source of truth, full context in briefings
‚úÖ **Documentation validation** - CHANGELOG checks, docstring validation, architecture diagrams

#### **Phase 5.8-5.9: Distribution & Structure (v0.5.8 - v0.6.0)**
‚úÖ **Marketplace plugin support** - Works from Claude Code marketplace with `pip install -e`
‚úÖ **Unified CLI** - All commands use `sdd` executable
‚úÖ **Standard Python structure** - src/ layout following PEP 517/518
‚úÖ **Zero sys.path manipulation** - Clean imports with `from sdd.* import`
‚úÖ **Production-ready packaging** - Ready for PyPI distribution

### Test Coverage & Quality

- **1,408 tests** across unit, integration, and end-to-end
- **85%+ code coverage** maintained
- **8 CI/CD workflows** ensuring quality
- **Battle-tested** on real development projects

---

## Current State (v0.6.0)

### What Works Today

**Session Workflow:**
- Complete session lifecycle with quality gates
- Multi-session work item support (in-progress tracking)
- Automatic context loading and state management
- Git workflow automation (branching, commits, merges)

**Work Item Management:**
- 6 comprehensive work item types with spec templates
- Dependency resolution and critical path analysis
- Milestone tracking and progress visualization
- Spec-first workflow with validation

**Knowledge Management:**
- Automatic learning extraction and categorization
- Duplicate detection and merging
- Full-text search and filtering
- Growing knowledge base across sessions

**Quality Enforcement:**
- Automated testing and coverage requirements
- Security scanning (bandit, safety, npm audit)
- Code quality checks (linting, formatting)
- Documentation validation
- Integration testing and performance benchmarks
- Deployment validation and rollback automation

**Developer Experience:**
- Clean CLI with `sdd` command
- 15+ slash commands for Claude Code
- Comprehensive documentation and guides
- Template-driven workflow

### Installation

**Method 1: Claude Code Marketplace**
```bash
# After installing from marketplace:
pip install -e ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/claude-plugins/sdd
```

**Method 2: Direct Installation**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ankushdixit/sdd.git
cd sdd
pip install -e .
```

## Future Roadmap

### v0.7.0: PyPI Publishing (Next)

**Goal:** Make SDD publicly available via PyPI for simple installation

**Status:** üìÖ PLANNED

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Prepare package metadata for PyPI
- [ ] Create PyPI account and verify email
- [ ] Test upload to TestPyPI
- [ ] Publish to PyPI: `pip install sdd`
- [ ] Update marketplace plugin to be lightweight (commands only)
- [ ] Update documentation with PyPI installation instructions
- [ ] Announcement and release notes

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Simple installation: `pip install sdd`
- ‚úÖ Version management through PyPI
- ‚úÖ Automatic updates via `pip install --upgrade sdd`
- ‚úÖ Wider adoption and discoverability
- ‚úÖ Professional distribution channel

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days

---

### v0.8.0+: Advanced Features (Optional)

**Status:** üìÖ FUTURE (Implement as needed)

These features may be added based on community feedback and real-world usage:

#### **Custom Work Item Types**
- User-defined work item schemas
- Custom validation rules per type
- Template system for specifications
- Type-specific quality gates

#### **Metrics & Analytics**
- Session velocity tracking
- Work item completion trends
- Learning accumulation rate
- Quality gate pass/fail rates
- Coverage trends over time
- Time estimates vs. actual

#### **Project Presets**
- Web application preset
- Python library preset
- CLI tool preset
- Microservices preset
- Auto-configure based on project type

#### **Enhanced Documentation**
- ADR (Architecture Decision Records) templates
- Requirement ‚Üí work item traceability
- Documentation generation from specs
- Version tracking and sync detection

#### **AI-Powered Enhancements**
- Context-aware session suggestions
- Automatic priority recommendations
- Smart dependency detection
- Work item decomposition suggestions
- Time estimation from historical data

---

## Not Planned

The following features are **intentionally excluded** from the roadmap:

‚ùå **Spec-Kit Integration**
- Current work item + spec schema is comprehensive
- Integration would add complexity without clear benefit
- Our templates and validation are battle-tested

‚ùå **Team Collaboration Features**
- SDD is focused on solo development workflow
- Multi-developer support adds significant complexity
- May reconsider based on community demand

‚ùå **Enterprise Features**
- SSO, audit logs, compliance reporting, RBAC
- Out of scope for developer productivity tool
- Focus remains on individual developer experience

‚ùå **External Tool Deep Integrations**
- Notion, Linear, Jira, Slack, Discord
- Git-based workflow is sufficient
- Avoid vendor lock-in and maintenance burden

‚ùå **Web-Based Dashboard**
- Terminal-based workflow is core philosophy
- Metrics and graphs not needed for most workflows
- CLI provides sufficient visibility
