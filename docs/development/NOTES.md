# Development Notes

This file is a placeholder for personal notes during development.

Use this space to:
- Document temporary observations or hypotheses
- Track debugging insights during active development
- Keep quick reminders for ongoing work
- Note down ideas for future improvements

These notes are meant to be temporary and personal. For permanent documentation:
- **Project decisions** → `docs/architecture/DECISIONS.md`
- **Implementation details** → `docs/development/IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- **Known issues** → GitHub Issues
- **Session learnings** → `.session/learnings/` (captured via `/learn` command)
